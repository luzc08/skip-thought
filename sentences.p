VBreast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer death in women.
p2
aVDespite extensive research, the precise mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis remain unclear.
p3
aVOne of the reasons for this is due, at least in part, to a lack of a suitable animal model which can closely mimic the breast carcinogenesis in normal situations without using chemical carcinogens.
p4
aVWe have developed an animal model of mammary gland carcinogenesis using a combination of oestradiol and testosterone, and succeeded in inducing a high percentage of female Noble rats to develop mammary cancer in a relatively short time (~6 months).
p5
aVThe results showed that androgens might work as a promoter to shorten the latency time of mammary gland carcinogenesis.
p6
aVHistopathological examination revealed that hyperplasia and dysplasia were first observed 2 months after treatment, in situ carcinoma after 3 months, and fully developed carcinoma of various forms including cribriform, papillary and camedo types were observed from 5 to 6 months after hormone implantation.
p7
aVAnimals implanted with oestrogen or testosterone alone also developed mammary cancers, though with a lower overall incidence than the two hormones combined.
p8
aVThey ranged from well differentiated to poorly differentiated forms with predominantly infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
p9
aVWe have also observed a case of secondary cancer in the uterus.
p10
aVIn addition to the high incidence of carcinoma, there was also a peculiar unexplained ipsilateral correlation between the site of hormonal implantation and the location of tumours, and the highest incidence of carcinogenesis was found to be in thoracic mammary gland.
p11
aVThe study showed that both oestrogens and androgens are important in mammary cancer development.
p12
aVThe animal model would prove to be a useful model for analysis of the mechanism(s) of hormonal carcinogenesis.
p13
aVBreast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer death in women (1).
p14
aVThe American Cancer Society has estimated that there will be 178 700 new breast cancer cases and ~16% of all cancer related mortality (43 500 cancer related deaths) in 1998.
p15
aVUnlike the common non-hormone-dependent adult cancers, breast cancer is exceptional before the age of 20 years and is rare below 30 years but then the incidence rises very steadily up to the age of 50 years, after which the rate of increase slows down, although the incidence rate continues to rise.
p16
aVThis shows that a relationship must exist between ovarian hormones and breast cancer, although it has not been clarified which specific hormones are involved in the breast carcinogenesis (2).
p17
aVThe epidemiological evidence provides strong support for this concept (3).
p18
aVFrom among the various recognized risk factors, age of menarche, age of first pregnancy and age of menopause suggest that endogenous sex hormones may play the predominant role at all stages in the development of breast cancer (4\u20139).
p19
aVBecause of their physiologic stimulatory actions on mammary gland, oestrogens, especially oestrone and oestradiol, have long been linked to the risk of breast cancer (10).
p20
aVEpidemiological evidence derives from investigating the effects of exogenous oestrogens on the incidence of breast cancer, such as long-term use of oral contraceptive pills (11) and oestrogen replacement therapy (12), supports this linkage.
p21
aVFurthermore, animal studies have shown repeatedly that oestrogens are able to induce and promote mammary tumours, and removal of ovaries, or administration of anti-oestrogenic drugs, achieves the opposite effect (13).
p22
aVHowever, the epidemiological evidence linking oestrogens with breast cancer risk is provocative but not conclusive for two reasons.
p23
aVFirstly, repeated full-term pregnancies at an early age, with the consequence of long-lasting increase of oestrogenic levels, are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.
p24
aVSecondly, the highest incidence of breast cancer is observed in old women when the oestrogenic level has been very low for decades (14).
p25
aVConsiderable efforts have been made in the past in attempting to show that women with high risk of breast cancer and/or those who subsequently develop the disease have abnormal endocrine profiles.
p26
aVHowever, comparative studies of high- and low-risk groups and familial studies have failed to yield consistent evidence that individuals' urinary and plasma oestrogen levels are associated with the increased risk (15).
p27
aVInterestingly, the evidence for urinary and plasma steroids is stronger for androgens than for oestrogens in predicting breast cancer (16).
p28
aVBased on these observations, androgens have also been proposed as a possible carcinogenic factor in breast cancer (3).
p29
aVThis proposal is mainly supported by the fact that the incidence of breast cancer is high in post-menopausal women when androgenic levels are high (17).
p30
aVFurthermore, administration of androgens for cystic disease has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer (18).
p31
aVIt has been reported that higher androgens and lower progesterone levels have been found in pre-menopausal women with breast cancer compared with controls (19).
p32
aVMoreover, Japanese women, who have a lower risk of breast cancer than their American and British counterparts, have lower plasma androgen levels.
p33
aVMore recently, a number of researchers have demonstrated that, among all plasma steroids, the evidence for association of testosterone levels with breast cancer is strongest, although they could not determine whether this association is a cause or an effect of malignancy (20).
p34
aVHowever, although quite a few studies have evaluated plasma androgen levels in relation to breast cancer risk, the results have been inconsistent.
p35
aVTestosterone has been positively associated with breast cancer in most (21\u201326), but not all (27,28), previous studies.
p36
aVFurthermore, most studies suggested that increased levels of testosterone might have a modest but indirect association with breast cancer through its conversion to oestradiol (29,30).
p37
aVThe uncertainty of the roles of sex hormones, especially androgens, in breast carcinogenesis is, at least in part, due to a lack of a suitable animal model to enable researchers to carry out detailed investigations.
p38
aVThe two most widely used experimental systems for the study of mammary cancer involve the use of chemical carcinogens, such as 1,2-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and N-methylnitrosourea.
p39
aVThese rodent models are excellent to study the early events of chemical carcinogenesis, malignant progression, and for carrying out in vivo signal transduction studies towards some oncogene-mediated events, such as ras-mediated events (31).
p40
aVHowever, these models, as well as other models induced by adenovirus and ionizing radiation, are not ideal for investigating mammary carcinogenesis, as they do not closely mimic the hormonal situation in normal animals.
p41
aVNoble and his colleagues had conducted pioneering studies on the induction of mammary cancer by steroid hormones in a rat strain (Noble) (32).
p42
aVBecause of their interests in prostate carcinogenesis, very little details about mammary carcinogenesis were given in the report.
p43
aVFurthermore, they used estrone, one of the most cytotoxic forms of oestrogen, which is present in high levels only in post-menopausal women.
p44
aVKey (33) has reviewed the relationship of hormones and cancer in humans and suggested that sex hormones affect both early and late stages in breast carcinogenesis.
p45
aVOestradiol is the main form of oestrogen which affects the early stage of breast carcinogenesis.
p46
aVWe have developed a new animal model for mammary cancer based on Noble's method (32), with an important modification, using a combination of testosterone and 17\u03b2-oestradiol (E2), which more closely mimics breast cancer in human.
p47
aVUsing this animal model, we have successfully induced the development of a high percentage of mammary cancer in female Noble rats.
p48
aVWe have examined the expression of tumour growth factor-\u03b2 and vascular endothelial growth factor and their receptors in mammary cancer (34\u201336).
p49
aVWe have established that an autocrine growth regulatory mechanism exists in this mammary cancer (B.Xie et al., submitted for publication).
p50
aVWe have also carried out a comparative study to further investigate the role of sex hormones, especially testosterone, in mammary carcinogenesis.
p51
aVWe found that prolonged treatment with a combination of oestradiol and testosterone induces much higher incidence of mammary cancer in Noble rats, than either hormone alone.
p52
aVThe histopathological patterns of the induced tumours and the number of tumours per tumour-bearing animal very closely resemble human breast tumours.
p53
aVFurthermore, the dosage of testosterone, although it does not influence the cumulative tumour incidence, does affect the tumour latency period.
p54
aVThis suggests that testosterone may act as a promoter in the mammary tumorigenesis.
p55
aVThus, the study: (i) provides the first in vivo evidence that both oestrogens and androgens are important cause for mammary tumorigenesis and that androgens may work synergistically as a promoter to shorten the latency period; and (ii) offers a useful animal model for exploring the mechanisms involved in human breast carcinogenesis, especially for the evaluation of the role of androgens in mammary tumorigenesis.
p56
aVThe animals were housed in wire mesh suspended stainless steel cages, three to a cage, under standard conditions (22 ± 2°C, 40\u201370% relative humidity, 12 h light\u201312 h dark).
p57
aVAnimals were fed with standard rat chow with tap water ad libitum.
p58
aVBody weights were recorded weekly.
p59
aVAll surgical operation was done under pentobarbitone anaesthesia.
p60
aVThe skin area involved was shaved and sterilized with 70% alcohol.
p61
aVA small incision was made and hormone-filled Silastic tubings were inserted into the subcutaneous tissue.
p62
aVAnimals were killed at the end of experiments by cervical dislocation.
p63
aVAt 3 months of age, intact sexually mature female Noble rats, weighing 180\u2013210 g, were randomly divided into six groups, according to the protocols listed in Figure 1.
p64
aVRats of groups IL and IR were surgically implanted s.c. in the left and right inguinal regions, respectively, with four 2.0 cm Silastic tubings [(i.d.
p65
aV1.6 mm, o.d.
p66
aV3.2 mm) sealed with RTV-108 silicone rubber adhesive sealant (General Electric, Waterford, NY)], tightly packed with testosterone propionate (each 2 cm tubing = 30 mg, total 120 mg) (Sigma) and one 1.0 cm Silastic tubing containing E2 benzoate (22 mg) (Sigma, St Louis, MO).
p67
aVIn groups II and III, rats were implanted s.c. in the left inguinal region with one 1.0 cm Silastic tubing of E2 benzoate (22 mg) and four 2.0 cm Silastic tubings of testosterone propionate (120 mg), respectively.
p68
aVGroup IV received one 1.0 cm E2 benzoate (22 mg) and two 2.0 cm testosterone propionate (60 mg) tubings.
p69
aVIn group V, rats received empty Silastic tubings sealed with the same sealant.
p70
aVAll tubings were replaced at 3 month intervals.
p71
aVIn order to investigate the correlation between the number of testosterone implants and serum testosterone levels we also carried out an experiment of shorter duration, by treating the rats with two, four or six testosterone implants (2T, 4T and 6T, respectively).
p72
aVThe rats were palpated regularly for mammary tumours starting from 2 months after treatment.
p73
aVThe rats were killed when they became moribund or when a tumour &gt;2 cm in diameter was detected.
p74
aVA small number were killed from 2 months onward to detect any early changes in mammary glands even when no palpable lumps were detected.
p75
aVThe remaining rats, including non-tumour bearing and those with tumours &lt;2 cm in diameter, were killed at 12 months after the initiation of treatment.
p76
aVAt autopsy, the mammary tumours were removed and fixed immediately in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.2), trimmed and embedded in paraffin.
p77
aVThe remaining mammary glands, though without obvious palpable tumour development were also removed for further examination.
p78
aVParaffin sections (4 \u03bcm in thickness) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for histopathological examination, using the criteria and classification of mammary tumours as outlined by Young and Hallowes (37) and Russo et al.
p79
aV(38).
p80
aVTo determine the concentration of serum testosterone and E2, 5 ml of venous blood were collected in a plastic tube without additives at the end of experiment and after the animals had been killed.
p81
aVAfter clotting at room temperature, the tubes were centrifuged lightly and the serum was aspirated.
p82
aVThe serum testosterone concentration was determined by ELISA method using EIAgen Testosterone Kit (BioChem ImmunoSystems, Rome, Italy), whereas the serum E2 concentration was measured by enzyme-linked fluorescent assay using VIDAS Oestradiol II Kit and mini VIDAS instrument (bioMerieux Vitek, Marcy L'Etoile, France).
p83
aVThe Iball's index is defined as the ratio of incidence (%) to the average latency period in days, multiplied by 100 (39).
p84
aVStatistical analyses were carried out using Fisher's exact probability test for incidence.
p85
aVData of body weight, serum testosterone concentration and serum E2 concentration were given as means ± SD.
p86
aVANOVA was used to compare the means of the groups investigated.
p87
aVStudent-Newman-Keuls was used as post-hoc test to determine the level of significance between two mean values.
p88
aVWe used the statistical software program SPSS 7.0 to generate the analysis (40).
p89
aVA P-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistical significant.
p90
aVWe measured the serum testosterone and E2 concentration in different experiment durations (from 3 to 12 months) and with different treatments (i.e.
p91
aV1E + 4T, 1E + 2T, 1E and 4T).
p92
aVThe differences of serum testosterone concentration between groups IL and IV were very significant, whereas the differences between groups IL and III were not significant (Table I).
p93
aVThe coefficients of variance (CVs) in the four experimental groups were very small, indicating the serum testosterone concentration was relatively constant during the period.
p94
aVIn order to explore the correlation between the number of testosterone implants and the serum testosterone concentration, we further carried out an experiment of shorter (7 weeks) duration.
p95
aVThe results showed that the serum hormonal concentration was very strongly positively correlated with the number of testosterone implants (Table II, R = 0.998).
p96
aVFurthermore, the serum testosterone concentration had shown no significant fluctuation between the time of 7 weeks and during the period of 3\u201312 months, indicating that the serum levels of testosterone in group IL were relatively constant during the period studied.
p97
aVA very small CV (7.97%) of concentration of testosterone in serum provides additional support for the stable serum levels of testosterone during the period studied.
p98
aVThe results of serum E2 concentration are shown in Table III.
p99
aVThe differences among groups IL, IV and II were not significant.
p100
aVAlthough the serum E2 concentration in group III was higher than that in control group, the difference was also statistically not significant.
p101
aVHowever, the serum E2 concentrations in groups IL, IV and II were significantly higher (~40-fold) than those in group III and control groups.
p102
aVThe body weight of the hormone-treated rats was lower than that of controls, except for the group treated with testosterone alone (group III), which showed no significant difference to the control (Figure 2).
p103
aVThe body weight of rats treated with oestradiol was maintained at a very stable level, while the weight of rats treated with testosterone alone increased steadily, although the rate of increase became slower after 20 weeks.
p104
aVBy 40 weeks, there was no difference between the testosterone-treated and control groups.
p105
aVThe weight of rats treated with a combination of testosterone and oestradiol increased only slightly.
p106
aVThe results of hormone-induced mammary carcinogenesis are summarized in Tables IV and V and in Figure 3.
p107
aVSpontaneous development of mammary tumours was not observed (in control group) during the experimental period of 12 months.
p108
aVCompared with other groups, the rats in group IL showed a significantly increased incidence of mammary cancer (52.78%), with a latency period of 5.82 ± 1.77 months, and with an average of just greater than one tumour per tumour-bearing rat (1.16 ± 0.37).
p109
aVAlthough multiple tumours had been observed in animals, most rats had only one tumour at the time of killing (Table V).
p110
aVFurthermore, most tumours induced were detected in thoracic mammary gland, only very rarely had tumours been observed in cervical, abdominal or inguinal mammary glands.
p111
aVThe tumour incidence was 22.22% in group II (E2 alone) and 16.67% in group III (testosterone alone), which was not statistically significant between them.
p112
aVThe highest Iball's index score for the overall development of mammary tumour was observed in group IL, which was 3-fold higher than that in group II and 4-fold higher than that in group III.
p113
aVThe Iball's index of group IL was also significantly higher than that in group IV, which received one E2 and two testosterone capsules.
p114
aVAs shown in Figure 3, the appearance of the first tumour occurred ~1\u20132 months earlier in the group IL than in groups II, III and IV.
p115
aVSignificant differences in the cumulative incidence of tumours were observed between groups IL (44.44%) and II (11.11%), starting from 6.8 months.
p116
aVOn the other hand, the difference in latency period between groups IL and IV was statistically significant, although there was no difference in cumulative incidence among them (52.78 and 53.33%, respectively; Figure 3 and Table IV).
p117
aVThe correlation between the location of tumours and the site of implantation of sex hormones was very strong.
p118
aVIn group IL, &gt;85% tumours appeared on the left side while in group IR all tumours (100%) were found on the right side amid a relatively small number of animals.
p119
aVThe difference was highly significant (P &lt; 0.01, Table V).
p120
aVMammary glands from age-matched control animals were characterized by a sparse cluster of epithelial tubules, embedded in a small amount of connective tissue, surrounded by a large fat pad.
p121
aVThe epithelial ducts had small lumen, and darkly stained cuboidal epithelial cells (Figure 4).
p122
aVMammary glands of all rats implanted with a combination of testosterone and oestradiol had a more extensively branched and dilated alveolar or ductal system against a background of loose connective tissue stroma.
p123
aVThe alveoli or ducts showed a variable degree of epithelial dysplasia (Figure 5) after 2 months.
p124
aVFocal areas of dysplastic cells were seen interspersed among relatively normal glandular cells.
p125
aVDysplastic cells were characterized by a loss of polarity and pleomorphic nuclear morphology.
p126
aVIrregular proliferation of epithelium within ducts were often accompanied by an apparent increase in the secretory activity.
p127
aVWe also observed a marked dilation of ducts resulting from the accumulation of secretory material, foamy cell debris and macrophages in the lumen (Figures 5 and 6).
p128
aVTypically, patches of dysplastic and carcinomal cells were seen as focal thickening of epithelium extending into the lumen (Figures 6 and 7).
p129
aVMany alveoli or ducts were seen to be filled completely or partially by tumour cells.
p130
aVThese were referred to as carcinoma in situ (Figures 6\u20138).
p131
aVThe fully developed carcinoma had variable histopathological features ranging from papillary (Figure 8), cribriform (Figure 9) or comedo (Figure 10) patterns, alone or in combination.
p132
aVThe papillary pattern consists of bulbous, seemingly fragile, neoplastic epithelial projections protruding into the lumen of the ducts (Figure 8) were often seen in early development.
p133
aVThese projections were composed of relatively uniform cells with small nuclei, arranged haphazardly or at right angles to the long axis of the papillae.
p134
aVThe cribriform pattern was characterized by neoplastic cells which extended into the ductal lumen to form bridges of anastomosing arcades with many vacuole-like structure (Figure 9).
p135
aVVery often, tumours appeared as multilayered cells surrounding a central necrotic debris, resulting in comedo pattern (Figure 10).
p136
aVCentral necrosis with dystrophic calcification was particularly common in this pattern.
p137
aVAs the tumours enlarged further, they invaded the stroma, forming the typical infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma (Figures 11 and 12).
p138
aVInfiltrating ductal carcinoma also could develop into papillary, cribriform or comedo patterns.
p139
aVThe well-differentiated type of infiltrating ductal carcinoma retained a tendency to form tubules and alveoli (Figure 11), while the moderately differentiated type was characterized by some features of glandular formation within the tumour masses.
p140
aVThe poorly differentiated carcinoma was characterized by solid masses of poorly organized tumour virtually devoid of glandular formation (Figure 12).
p141
aVVery often, isolated islets or single tumour cells were seen infiltrating the connective tissue stroma (Figure 12).
p142
aVAlthough the breast tumours induced by testosterone and oestradiol were of all ranges, the predominant type was solid adenocarcinomas with moderate stroma and obvious evidence of local invasiveness.
p143
aVClose proximity of tumour cells to stromal areas were frequently observed (Figure 13).
p144
aVHowever, only one rat was found bearing a metastatic tumour in the uterus (Figure 15), while another one was believed to have invaded the underlying thoracic muscular layer (Figure 14).
p145
aVThe possibility of primary uterine tumour was considered and excluded due to the fact that there was no tumour observed anywhere in the endometrium.
p146
aVThe histopathology of tumours induced by oestradiol or testosterone alone was similar to those induced by a combination of testosterone and oestradiol.
p147
aVThe results of the present study show that in the rat, mammary tumours can be readily induced by a combination of E2 and testosterone.
p148
aVOver 50% of animals developed mammary cancer after sex hormone implantation, with an overall latency period of ~6 months.
p149
aVTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document in a systematic way, the successful induction of mammary carcinogenesis by a combination of female and male sex hormones, without addition of chemical carcinogens.
p150
aVWe believe this is a far better model for in depth study of the mechanisms of mammary carcinogenesis, as it closely mimics the natural human breast cancer.
p151
aVThe existing animal models for mammary cancer mostly involved the use of potent chemical carcinogens (41\u201343).
p152
aVThey do not mimic human mammary cancer well for at least three reasons.
p153
aVFirstly, the breast is a sex hormone target organ and has little chance to contact chemical carcinogens in any significant way under normal situations.
p154
aVSecondly, mammary cancers induced by chemical carcinogens are commonly multiple in number and the number of malignant tumours per rat shows a dose dependency (44).
p155
aVHowever, in clinical practice the finding of a double carcinoma in the same breast and of a simultaneous bilateral carcinoma is infrequent (14).
p156
aVThirdly, certain oncogenes, such as the ras gene, are extremely rare in human breast cancers but are substantially expressed in chemically induced mammary cancers (31,45).
p157
aVIn time, this will prove to be most suitable for detailed analysis of mammary carcinogenesis, especially for the role of these hormones in mammary cancer development.
p158
aVFurthermore, most of the tumours induced by a combination of testosterone and oestradiol bear a striking resemblance, not only in growth patterns but also in histopathology, to their human counterparts.
p159
aVAlthough involvement of multiple mammary glands has been observed in three rats, the tumours usually occurred singly in a given rat.
p160
aVExamination of the expression of oestrogen receptor, some common oncogenes and growth factors as well as their receptors in these cancers (unpublished observation), have revealed that they behaved very similarly to human breast cancers.
p161
aVOn the other hand, the low rate of distant metastases observed in our study is also consistent with observations in clinical situations in women.
p162
aVHuman breast carcinoma frequently invades adjacent lymphatic vessels and blood vessels and metastasizes to axillary nodes, but distant metastases are rarely present at the time of first diagnosis of breast cancer (14).
p163
aVIn our study, close proximity of cancer cells to vessels, suggesting potential vascular invasion, were frequently observed, but only one rat bearing metastatic tumour in uterus was observed with another case of invasion to the underlying muscular tissues.
p164
aVAnother factor which may explain the relatively low rate of metastasis, the fact that animals were killed when tumours were still relatively small.
p165
aVHad we allowed tumours to proceed further in development, a higher metastatic rate might have resulted.
p166
aVThis Future-work is Future-work being Future-work examined Future-work at Future-work the Future-work moment.
p167
aVFuture-work Although the most common sites of distant metastases in human are lungs, bones and liver (14), breast carcinoma metastasizes to uterus have also been reported (46).
p168
aVBased on these observations, we consider that mammary carcinogenesis induced by testosterone and oestradiol is a model that mimics human breast cancer most closely.
p169
aVThus, it can be used to elucidate the role and mechanism of sex hormones in mammary carcinogenesis.
p170
aVThe latest epidemiological evidence shows that increased levels of major sex steroid hormones (androgens and oestrogens) in the blood play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women (47\u201350).
p171
aVHowever, the persisting controversies about the relationship between the hormone levels and the subsequent development of breast cancer still remain (51).
p172
aVThere are at least two factors thought to be responsible for these discrepancies.
p173
aVFirstly, serum hormone measurements are subject to variation by many factors, including age, health status, laboratory variations and time of day when samples are taken.
p174
aVFurthermore, the underlying genetic differences in hormone metabolism among individuals may also introduce variables that may distort the results of studies of serum hormone levels.
p175
aVSecondly, although it is currently believed that androgens are strongly associated with breast cancer risk, it is still unknown whether androgens are a cause or an effect of breast carcinogenesis and whether androgens have a direct or an indirect effect on breast carcinogenesis (3,17).
p176
aVOur observation showed that testosterone implanted alone had the ability to induce mammary carcinogenesis in female Noble rats.
p177
aVAlthough the mechanism is not clear, it tends to support the hypothesis that androgens may have a direct role in mammary carcinogenesis, in addition to its role through oestradiol indirectly by conversion through aromatase activity.
p178
aVThe results from our present study suggest that androgens may be a cause rather than an effect of mammary carcinogenesis in the rat.
p179
aVThe incidence and Iball's index in the rats treated with testosterone and oestradiol is significantly higher than those treated with either testosterone or oestradiol alone.
p180
aVReduction in testosterone dosage while keeping the oestradiol level unchanged, increases the latency period, but not the cumulative incidence of mammary cancers.
p181
aVThe results suggest that the two hormones act synergistically on the mammary gland, in mammary carcinogenesis, with testosterone playing a crucial role in the process.
p182
aVA summary of the literature to date reveals the following: (i) androgens may act directly, by stimulating breast epithelial cell proliferation through binding to androgen receptors or by stimulating the synthesis of growth factors in the breast epithelium (52); (ii) androgens may act indirectly through conversion of androgens to oestrogens (53); (iii) androgens may also increase indirectly the risk of breast cancer by decreasing the fraction of oestradiol bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing the unbound (free) oestradiol fraction, which is thought to be the fraction available to breast cells (54); and (iv) it has been suggested that testosterone inhibits hepatic secretion of SHBG (55), which could also result in a decreased fraction of oestradiol bound to SHBG.
p183
aVOur finding that the incidence of mammary cancer induced by a combination of the two hormones is higher than those induced by either hormone alone, indicates that the two hormones, as pointed out earlier, can act synergistically in the mammary gland tissue, to induce mammary carcinogenesis.
p184
aVWhat might be the most likely way that androgens increase mammary cancer incidence?
p185
aVThere is no definitive answer to this question for the time being.
p186
aVIn this study, we have observed that, compared with controls, treatment with testosterone alone can also induce breast carcinogenesis.
p187
aVThis result was surprising to us initially.
p188
aVWe believe the real answer rests with synergism between testosterone and oestrogen.
p189
aVAs has been established, testosterone can be converted to oestrogens by aromatase.
p190
aVAlthough the amount of testosterone implanted that eventually got converted into oestrogen is not known in this case, a scenario of coexistence of oestrogens (natural and converted) and testosterone can be established.
p191
aVWe believe a synergistic effect of oestrogen and testosterone continues to exist in this situation.
p192
aVSimilarly, compared with oestradiol-treated rats, treatment with a combination of testosterone and oestradiol shortens the latency period.
p193
aVWhen the number of tubings containing testosterone was reduced to half (1E2 + 2T) of those used in group IL (1E2 + 4T), no significant difference in cumulative incidence was observed but the latency period was significantly longer than in group IL.
p194
aVThe rate of release of testosterone from Silastic tubings is correlated to the surface area of the tubings, reducing the number of the tubings would, therefore, result in decreasing the dosage of testosterone.
p195
aVOn the other hand, treatment of intact male rats with testosterone alone does not induce mammary tumour, while a combination of testosterone and oestradiol does (data not shown), indicating that androgen is not a dominant factor in mammary carcinogenesis.
p196
aVWe have measured serum testosterone and E2 concentrations.
p197
aVThe results showed that there is no significant fluctuation in serum E2 levels in the presence of E2 implant, irrespective of whether the animals were treated with E2 alone or in combination with testosterone (i.e.
p198
aV1E + 4T or 1E + 2T).
p199
aVThere is also no significant difference in serum testosterone levels whether the treatment was by testosterone alone or in combination with E2 (i.e.
p200
aV1E + 4T).
p201
aVHowever, the level of serum testosterone was reduced when the dosage of testosterone was reduced (i.e.
p202
aV1E + 2T).
p203
aVThese results show that the levels of serum testosterone or E2 are not significantly altered by the combination of these hormones.
p204
aVThis indicates that the concentration of one hormone (e.g.
p205
aVtestosterone) is not affected by another hormone (e.g.
p206
aVE2) in the blood and vice versa.
p207
aVHowever, the incidence of mammary carcinogenesis is substantially higher in rats treated with a combination of E2 and testosterone than either hormone alone, suggesting that some forms of synergism must have occurred.
p208
aVOur study further shows that a reduction of testosterone dosage by half (e.g.
p209
aVfrom 1E + 4T to 1E + 2T) does not result in a significant decrease of serum E2 level but a significant decrease of serum testosterone level.
p210
aVGiven the fact that different dosage of testosterone affects the latency period of mammary carcinogenesis, but does not affect the cumulative incidence of mammary cancer, these observations lead us to speculate that testosterone may act as an endogenous promoter in mammary carcinogenesis and this role may be through stimulation of secretion of growth factors and oncogenes in mammary glands rather than stimulation of breast cell proliferation.
p211
aVOur results further show that the site of hormone implantation has a significant influence on the origin of mammary cancers.
p212
aVThis finding was surprising.
p213
aVIn our preliminary study, all hormone implants were made subcutaneously in the left inguinal region.
p214
aVIn these animals, &gt;85% of tumours were found to occur on the left, especially the left thoracic mammary gland (rats mainly have four pairs of mammary glands i.e.
p215
aVcervical, thoracic, abdominal and inguinal mammary glands).
p216
aVWe consequently added another group in which the hormones were all implanted in the right inguinal region.
p217
aVTo our surprise, all tumours thus induced were on the right side, and predominantly occurred in the right thoracic mammary gland.
p218
aVThe reason for this peculiar ipsilateral correlation of the site of hormone implantation to breast tumour development is unknown.
p219
aVIf local diffusion, in addition to systematic blood circulation, was a factor, then the abdominal or inguinal mammary glands on the same side, which are nearer to hormonal implants in distance, should be affected more.
p220
aVThe fact that most tumours were found in thoracic glands indicate that factors other than distance from the hormonal source might be involved.
p221
aVThere is as yet no satisfactory explanation to this unexpected finding.
p222
aVIn an ongoing comparative study, we have measured the Ki-67 labeling index (proliferative index) and mammary gland density (MGD) to determine the proliferation of ductal epithelial and periductal stromal cells in response to hormone treatment.
p223
aVThe data show that, in 1E + 4T group, the Ki-67 labeling indices between left and right thoracic mammary glands are not significantly different.
p224
aVHowever, the MGD is significantly higher in the left than the right thoracic mammary glands (1.0214 ± 0.079 and 0.9288 ± 0.065 g/cm3, respectively), indicating that the proliferation of perialveolar or periductal stroma is higher in the left than the right thoracic mammary glands (B.Xie et al., in preparation).
p225
aVWhether or not this has anything to do with the ipsilateral correlation of tumours remains to be elucidated.
p226
aVAnother unique feature was that most tumours were detected in the thoracic gland while much less frequently in other pairs, i.e.
p227
aVcervical, abdominal or inguinal glands.
p228
aVThe reason for this is again not certain.
p229
aVRusso et al.
p230
aV(56\u201358) have identified the terminal end bud (TEB) as the most likely site of the origin of breast carcinomas in this complex branching gland.
p231
aVThey also have reported that tumour incidence in the thoracic mammary glands is higher than in the abdominal mammary glands.
p232
aVThey ascribe this difference in carcinogenic response to the asynchronous development of glands in different topographic areas.
p233
aVThe thoracic glands, which are lagging behind in development, retain a higher concentration of TEB and, thus, a higher tendency towards carcinogenesis.
p234
aVOur observations are consistent with Russo's reports.
p235
aVIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates clearly that prolonged treatment with a combination of oestradiol and testosterone induces much higher incidence of mammary cancer in female Noble rats, regardless of the dosage of testosterone used.
p236
aVThe histopathological patterns of the induced tumours and the number of tumours per tumour-bearing animal bear close resemblance to human breast tumours.
p237
aVFurthermore, the dosage of testosterone, though it does not influence the tumour incidence, affects the tumour latency period.
p238
aVThis suggests that testosterone may act as a promoter in the mammary tumorigenesis.
p239
aVThus, our studies (i) provide in vivo evidence that both oestrogen and androgen are important causes of mammary tumorigenesis; (ii) offer a useful animal model for exploring the mechanisms involved in human breast tumorigenesis, especially for evaluation of the role of androgens in mammary tumorigenesis.
p240
aVPeroxisome proliferators (PPs) are a class of non-genotoxic chemicals that cause rodent liver enlargement and hepatocarcinogenesis.
p241
aVIn primary rat hepatocytes, PPs cause cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis and peroxisome proliferation.
p242
aVWe have investigated the role of different families of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in the mode of action of PPs.
p243
aVAddition of 50 \u03bcM nafenopin to primary rat hepatocyte cultures caused weak activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases and p38 MAP kinase.
p244
aVHowever, incubation of primary hepatocytes with the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 or the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD098059 prevented the induction of DNA synthesis and the suppression of transforming growth factor \u03b21-induced apoptosis by the PP nafenopin.
p245
aVIn contrast, in the presence of these MAP kinase inhibitors, nafenopin still induced palmitoyl CoA oxidation, a measure of peroxisome proliferation.
p246
aVWe have shown previously that PPs such as nafenopin require tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) to exert their effects on cellular proliferation and apoptosis.
p247
aVHere we show that treatment of primary rat hepatocyte cultures with nafenopin causes an increase in bioactive TNF-\u03b1 and that this process requires p38 MAP kinase activity.
p248
aVPeroxisome proliferators (PPs) are a class of non-genotoxic carcinogens that cause peroxisome proliferation and tumours in rodent liver.
p249
aVThe induction of DNA synthesis and suppression of apoptosis are implicated in the mechanism of carcinogenicity for these structurally diverse compounds (1\u20134).
p250
aVThe action of PPs in rodents is mediated via activation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), a ligand-activated transcription factor that can cause transcriptional regulation of genes associated with peroxisome proliferation and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (5,6).
p251
aVThe mechanisms by which PPs perturb liver growth are unknown but may involve the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (7,8).
p252
aVTNF-\u03b1 is produced mainly by activated macrophages and in smaller amounts by other cell types (9,10).
p253
aVKupffer cells, the resident hepatic macrophages, are a rich source of cytokines in the liver (11,12) and have been suggested to play a key role in the induction of hepatocyte proliferation caused by PPs (13,14).
p254
aVMitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways contribute to the transmission of extracellular signals that result in the direct or indirect phosphorylation of transcription factors and alterations in gene expression (15).
p255
aVThe MEK (MAP kinase kinase) and extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK) pathway is primarily responsible for responding to cellular proliferation signals, while the p38 MAP kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) respond to cellular stress signals (15\u201317).
p256
aVp38 MAP kinases are key mediators of the inflammatory response and are activated by cytokines, growth factors and a variety of cellular stresses, including heat shock, ionizing radiation, UV radiation and hyperosmolarity (18,19).
p257
aVActivation of both the p38 and the ERK families of MAP kinases has been shown to be involved in signalling pathways leading to TNF-\u03b1 release and IL-6 production by macrophages and other cell types (20,21).
p258
aVTo address the mechanism of hepatic growth perturbation by PPs, we have investigated the role of different families of MAP kinases.
p259
aVUsing specific inhibitors, we demonstrate that although MAP kinases are only weakly activated by the PP nafenopin, these pathways are required for growth regulation and suppression of apoptosis by PPs.
p260
aVHowever, neither family of MAP kinases are involved in PP-induced peroxisome proliferation.

p300
aVPlates were washed in water, dried and incubated in 1% SDS before measuring OD at 620 nm.
p301
aVStandard concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 were used on each individual plate to generate a standard curve.
p302
aVTo establish whether nafenopin activated different MAP kinases directly in primary rat hepatocyte cultures, we analysed the phosphorylated forms of ERK and p38 MAP kinases.
p303
aVWestern blotting using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of ERK MAP kinases showed strong activation of ERK MAP kinase in primary rat hepatocytes upon treatment with EGF (Figure 1A).
p304
aVHowever, weak activation of ERK MAP kinase was observed upon treatment with 50 \u03bcM nafenopin (Figure 1A).
p305
aVTreatment of primary rat hepatocyte cultures with TNF-\u03b1 resulted in a 2\u20133-fold increase in p38 activity (measured by activation of MAPKAP-K2 kinase) (Figure 1B).
p306
aVUnder these conditions, however, nafenopin only weakly activated p38 MAP kinase (Figure 1B).
p307
aVIn agreement with previous studies (17), the basal levels of p38 MAP kinase were found to be high in primary rat hepatocytes compared with other cell lines (not shown).
p308
aVAs described previously (25), addition of the PP nafenopin to primary rat hepatocyte cultures results in the suppression of spontaneous apoptosis and that induced by TGF-\u03b21.
p309
aVInhibition of TGF-\u03b21-induced apoptosis by nafenopin was measured by scoring changes in nuclear morphology (Figure 2A and B) and by measuring activation of caspases using cytosolic extracts from hepatocyte cultures (Figure 2C).
p310
aVIn both cases, nafenopin suppressed TGF-\u03b21-induced apoptosis by ~50%.
p311
aVTo investigate the role of MAP kinase signalling pathways in the suppression of apoptosis by PPs, we evaluated the effects of SB203580 and PD098059 on the response of primary rat hepatocytes to the PP nafenopin.
p312
aVAddition of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 or the MEK inhibitor PD098059 did not affect the levels of spontaneous apoptosis (not shown) or TGF-\u03b21-induced apoptosis (Figure 2A and B).
p313
aVHowever, pre-treatment of primary rat hepatocyte cultures with SB203580 or PD098059 prevented the suppression of TGF-\u03b21-induced apoptosis by nafenopin (Figure 2A and B).
p314
aVPPs cause cell replication in isolated rat hepatocytes.
p315
aVTo determine whether induction of S-phase by the PP nafenopin was dependent on MAP kinases, we treated primary rat hepatocytes with SB203580 or PD098059.
p316
aVStimulation of primary rat hepatocytes with nafenopin in the presence of SB203580 or PD098059, prevented the PP-induced increase in S-phase (Figure 3).
p317
aVThis suggests that MAP kinase activity is required for primary hepatocytes to undergo S-phase in response to PPs.
p318
aVBecause MAP kinase inhibitors affected the regulation of cell growth by PPs, we examined whether MAP kinases were also involved in peroxisome proliferation.
p319
aVCIPCO measurements were used as an indicator of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation associated with peroxisome proliferation.
p320
aVAs expected, nafenopin gave a strong induction of \u03b2-oxidation of palmitoyl CoA in this system, but this was unaffected by the presence of MAP kinase inhibitors (Figure 4).
p321
aVTherefore, inhibition of MAP kinases did not affect the induction of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation by nafenopin.
p322
aVp38 MAP kinase has been implicated in the regulation of TNF-\u03b1 production in monocytes and other cell types (28).
p323
aVWe therefore evaluated the effects of SB203580 on TNF-\u03b1 production in hepatocyte cultures in response to PP treatment.
p324
aVLevels of bioactive TNF-\u03b1 were found to increase in primary rat hepatocytes in response to treatment with nafenopin (Figure 5).
p325
aVThis increase was inhibited when cultures were pre-treated with SB203580 (Figure 5),
p326
aVindicating that p38 MAP kinase activity is required for the release of bioactive TNF-\u03b1 in response to PPs.
p327
aVThe mechanisms by which PPs regulate cellular proliferation and survival are still not known.
p328
aVIn this study, we have investigated the role of intracellular signalling via different MAP kinases in the mode of action of PPs.
p329
aVUsing specific inhibitors, we show that inhibition of different families of MAP kinases prevents the induction of S-phase and suppression of apoptosis by the PP nafenopin but does not prevent peroxisome proliferation.
p330
aVAs TNF-\u03b1 is thought to be a key mediator of the response to PPs, we show that one of the functions of MAP kinase signalling pathways may be to regulate the levels of this cytokine in the liver.
p331
aVTherefore, activation of distinct families of MAP kinases by different hepatic factors may play a permissive role in growth perturbation by PPs.
p332
aVIt has previously been shown that treatment of immortalized liver cell lines and rat hepatocytes with the PP Wy-14,643 causes activation of MAP kinases and induction of immediate early genes (29).
p333
aVThe data presented here confirm and extend these observations, to establish a causative link between activation of MAP kinases and effects on cell growth and survival.
p334
aVHowever, it is yet to be established whether activation of MAP kinase pathways by PPs induces cellular proliferation and suppression of apoptosis by a direct mechanism.
p335
aVIn this context, it is worth noting that under the conditions used in this study, PPs are weak mitogens compared with other factors, such as EGF in vitro (30).
p336
aVThis may partly explain the weak activation of ERK MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase observed.
p337
aVThe lack of effect of MAP kinase inhibitors on the levels of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation in primary hepatocytes suggests that the mechanism by which PPs regulate cell growth and survival is distinct from the mechanism of induction of peroxisome proliferation.
p338
aVHowever, both effects are dependent on the receptor PPAR\u03b1 (31).
p339
aVThe diverse effects of PPs in the liver may therefore be mediated by activation of different signalling pathways or by modulation of transcription of different genes.
p340
aVPPAR\u03b1 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated in response to insulin, resulting in enhanced transcriptional response (32).
p341
aVRecently, a ligand-independent transcriptional activation domain in PPAR\u03b1 has been shown to contain MAP kinase sites which are required for transcriptional activation by insulin (33).
p342
aVIn contrast, phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 has been shown to inhibit its transcriptional activity (34).
p343
aVAlthough we have established that MAP kinase activity is not required for PPAR\u03b1-mediated transcriptional activation of genes required for peroxisome proliferation, we cannot exclude a role for MAP kinases in PPAR\u03b1-mediated transcription of genes involved in growth regulation.
p344
aVThe inhibition of PP-mediated growth effects by MAP kinase inhibitors shown here, may be the result of indirect effects on signalling pathways triggered by cytokines and growth factors.
p345
aVThe p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and to inhibit the production of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6 (20,27,35).
p346
aVIndeed, in primary hepatocyte cultures, SB203580 prevented the increase in bioactive TNF-\u03b1 levels induced by treatment with the PP nafenopin.
p347
aVThese findings support a role for TNF-\u03b1 and perhaps other hepatic cytokines, as mediators of the growth regulatory effects of PPs.
p348
aVIn addition, our results support an indirect role for MAP kinases in the induction of cell growth and suppression of apoptosis by PPs.
p349
aVActivation of MAP kinase signalling pathways by hepatic cytokines or growth factors may play a permissive role in PP-induced growth regulation.
p350
aVActivation of ERK MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase by mitogens or cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 may be required for the growth changes to occur.
p351
aVInduction of oxidative stress by PPs (14,36) may also play a role in the activation MAP kinase pathways.
p352
aVIn particular, p38 MAP kinase has been associated with oxidative stress (18,37) and has been reported to be constitutively active in mouse liver (19).
p353
aVAlthough the ability of the PP class of rodent hepatocarcinogens to cause hepatic cell proliferation and survival have been described extensively, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this perturbation are still unclear.
p354
aVHere we demonstrate that the PP-induced regulation of cell growth and apoptosis involves different molecular mechanisms from the induction of peroxisome proliferation.
p355
aVTamoxifen was administered orally to neonatal rats on days 2\u20135 after birth and the subsequent effects on the uterus were characterized, morphometrically, over the following 12 months.
p356
aVTamoxifen inhibited development of the uterus and glands in the endometrium,
p357
aVindicating a classical oestrogen antagonist action.
p358
aVBetween 24 and 35 months after tamoxifen treatment there was a significant increase in the incidence (26%) of uterine adenocarcinomas and a 9% incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the vagina/cervix in the absence of any oestrogen agonist effect in the uterus.
p359
aVThis demonstrates that an oestrogen agonist effect is not an absolute requirement for the carcinogenic effect of tamoxifen in the reproductive tract of the rat.
p360
aVThe unopposed oestrogen agonist effect of tamoxifen on the endometrium may not be the only factor involved in the development of endometrial cancers.
p361
aVIt is possible that tamoxifen causes these tumours via a genotoxic mechanism similar to that seen in rat liver.
p362
aVHowever, using 32P-post-labelling we failed to find evidence of tamoxifen-induced DNA adducts in the uterus.
p363
aVTamoxifen may affect hormonal imprinting of oestrogen receptor responses in stem cells of the uterus, causing reproductive tract cancers to arise at a later time, in the same way as has been proposed for diethylstilbestrol.
p364
aVIf these rodent data extrapolate to humans, then women who are taking tamoxifen as a chemopreventative may have an increased risk of vaginal/cervical cancer, as well as endometrial cancer.
p365
aVMuch controversy has surrounded the finding of an increased risk of endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women taking tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (1\u20134).
p366
aVThe current explanation for this is that tamoxifen acts as an agonist of oestrogen action in the uterus, leading to hyperplasia of the endometrium, and thus promotes endogenous initiated cells to neoplasias, as with hormone replacement therapy (5).
p367
aVThis idea has been reinforced by numerous studies that have demonstrated thickening of the endometrium by ultrasonography during tamoxifen treatment, prior to the finding of polyps and adenocarcinomas of the endometrium (6).
p368
aVHowever, some endometrial tumours have been found to arise on a background of endometrial atrophy, which would not fit this theory (7,8).
p369
aVEndometrial adenocarcinomas associated with prolonged tamoxifen treatment have been attributed to a possible genotoxic effect of tamoxifen in the endometrium (9,10), although the evidence for this is not considered convincing (11), because of the low level of DNA adducts that have been found in endometrial biopsies from women taking tamoxifen (9,10).
p370
aVThe concept that tamoxifen could be genotoxic to women derives from the accumulation of DNA adducts in the livers of rats given tamoxifen that precedes the formation of liver cancers in as little as a year (12\u201314).
p371
aVTamoxifen is currently under evaluation as a chemopreventative for breast cancer in women with a high familial risk for developing this disease.
p372
aVA dramatic chemopreventative effect has already been reported in one trial (15), although this has not yet been confirmed in two other smaller trials taking place (16,17).
p373
aVAs the chemopreventative treatment period is likely to be longer than the treatment period for tamoxifen use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the long-term safety of tamoxifen use becomes even more important for risk\u2013benefit analysis of its chemopreventative use.
p374
aVIt is thus important to determine the underlying mechanism(s) of tamoxifen's uterine carcinogenicity in women.
p375
aVTo examine the role of an oestrogen agonist action of tamoxifen in the genesis of endometrial cancer and whether this is an essential requirement,
p376
aVtamoxifen was administered orally to neonatal rats on days 2\u20135 after birth at a dose of 1 mg/kg body wt/day.
p377
aVIn the adult rat, tamoxifen acts as an antagonist of oestrogen action with regard to the uterus and its development (18,19) and should, therefore, not give rise to uterine tumours by an oestrogen agonist promoting effect on the endometrium.
p378
aVThe subsequent development of the uterus was then monitored at three monthly intervals for the first year of life to determine whether such exposure affected normal development.
p379
aVBecause naturally occurring uterine cancer is a late onset tumour in rats, the animals were maintained for a further 23 months to monitor the development of such tumours.
p380
aVSeventy-eight female neonatal Wistar (Han) rats were given tamoxifen (1 mg/kg body wt/day) orally in peanut oil/lecithin/condensed milk mixture (2:0.2:3 w/w) on days 2\u20135 after birth.
p381
aVA group of 72 control rats was similarly dosed with the peanut oil/lecithin/condensed milk mixture.
p382
aVAt 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment, groups of six control and treated rats were killed by pentobarbitone overdose and the uteri were removed, weighed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for paraffin wax section preparation and morphometric histological evaluation.
p383
aVThe remaining (54 and 48 treated and control, respectively) animals were maintained on SDS RM 1 diet with ad libitum access to food and water for their normal lifespan (up to 35 months) to detect any long-term effects on the reproductive tract of neonatal exposure to tamoxifen.

aVMorphometric examination of the number of uterine gland profiles in three representative transverse sections was carried out on periodic acid\u2013Schiff base stained 5 \u03bcm sections, scoring only those gland profiles that were surrounded continuously by basement membrane as separate gland profiles.
p386
aVTumours were classified as adenocarcinomas of the uterus if they were derived from the glandular endometrium and were invasive of the myometrium, the peritoneal cavity or beyond.
p387
aVNBF fixed uterine sections (5 \u03bcm) were dewaxed with xylene, taken to water and microwaved in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 20 min at full power (700 W).
p388
aVFollowing microwaving, the sections were placed in distilled water at room temperature and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in water.
p389
aVA mouse monoclonal anti-human oestrogen receptor (ER) antibody (NCR-ER-6F11) was obtained from Vector Laboratories and used at a dilution of 1 in 25 (20,21).
p390
aVNCR-ER-6F11 recognizes full-length nER\u03b1; it does not recognize full-length ER\u03b2 by western blot comparison (Vector Laboratories, personal communication).
p391
aVA positive control of human endometrium was included in all batches of immunostains.
p392
aVImmunoreactive nuclei were visualized using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine/H2O2.
p393
aVSections were lightly counterstained with haematoxylin.
p394
aVUterine DNA from rats treated with tamoxifen and their respective controls, killed 24 h after the last treatment (day 6), were analysed for tamoxifen DNA adducts by 32P-post-labelling.
p395
aVDNA was extracted from the uteri of pooled litters (20 tamoxifen-treated and 20 control animals) by the method of Gupta (22) using proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction and digestion with RNase A and RNase T1.
p396
aVDNA purity and concentration were established spectrophotometrically.
p397
aVOnly DNA with a A260 nm/A280 nm ratio of 1.7\u20131.9 was used.
p398
aV32P-post-labelling was performed on 10 \u03bcg of each sample using nuclease P1 enhancement as previously described (14).
p399
aV32P-post-labelled DNA samples were then analysed by HPLC with on-line radiochemical detection or TLC (23).
p400
aVDifferences in body and uterine weights were analysed by ANOVAR with Dunnett's test for significance at the 5% level.
p401
aVTumour incidences were compared using Fisher's exact test.
p402
aVBody weights at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were not significantly affected by treatment (data not shown) while uterine weights (expressed as a percentage of body weight) were significantly reduced at 3 months after treatment, but gradually recovered after this time (data not shown).
p403
aVThe stage of the oestrous cycle was not determined for individual animals at death.
p404
aVFigure 1 shows the inhibition of development of the uterine glands in the endometrium subsequent to neonatal tamoxifen treatment on days 2\u20135.
p405
aVThis demonstrates that there was no chronic oestrogen agonist effect of tamoxifen; on the contrary, tamoxifen treatment at this developmentally sensitive time after birth inhibited the subsequent normal development of the endometrium and uterus.
p406
aVBetween 24 and 35 months following neonatal tamoxifen exposure, 26% of tamoxifen-treated animals had developed uterine endometrial adenocarcinomas (Figure 3a), compared with 6% in the control group (Figure 2 and Table I).
p407
aVThese were locally invasive tumours, which penetrated into and through the myometrium (Figure 3b) and into the peritoneal cavity.
p408
aVSome produced metastases to the lung.
p409
aVOne adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterus was also found in one animal in the tamoxifen treatment group (Table I).
p410
aVThere was a reduction in the expression of nER\u03b1 in tumour cells according to the degree of differentiation into endometrial adenocarcinomas.
p411
aVWell-differentiated adenocarcinomas of the uterus expressed nER\u03b1 strongly (Figure 3c), while loss of differentiation was associated with a loss or absence of nER\u03b1 staining (Figure 3d).
p412
aVThis was very similar to the progressive loss of nER\u03b1 staining associated with the development of tamoxifen-induced altered liver foci expressing GST-P as they progressed to adenomas and carcinomas in the liver (20).
p413
aVA further unexpected finding was the presence of a low, but significant, incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the vagina/cervix (9%) associated with neonatal tamoxifen treatment (Table I) 24\u201329 months after treatment (Figure 4).
p414
aVNone were found in the control animals.
p415
aVThe squamous parts of these tumours were not positive for nER\u03b1 expression.
p416
aVFollowing 32P-post-labelling of uterine DNA samples and analysis by HPLC with radiochemical detection or TLC (23), no DNA adduct peaks or spots could be detected in either the control or treated samples.
p417
aVThe limit of detection of DNA adducts using these conditions has been established as 1 adduct/109 nucleotides for HPLC and 0.5 adducts/1010 nucleotides for TLC (23).
p418
aVThe detection limits are calculated assuming that the labelling efficiency is 100%.
p419
aVThe significant increase in the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the endometrium could not be explained by an unopposed oestrogen agonist effect of tamoxifen, as this had been shown not to occur (Figure 1).
p420
aVThe present rodent study shows that tamoxifen can cause uterine cancers in rats in the absence of a sustained simple unopposed oestrogen agonist effect on the endometrium.
p421
aVHowever, it is still possible that tamoxifen acts as an oestrogen agonist only during the time of exposure on days 2\u20135 post-natally.
p422
aVThis could imply that even a brief alteration in the developmental, stage-specific expression of the oestrogen receptor, for instance, could have profound effects at a later age, when particular tissue compartments, such as the endometrium, become more responsive to endogenous hormones.
p423
aVThe finding of a low, but significant, incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the vagina with neonatal tamoxifen treatment may also indicate that, like diethylstilbestrol (DES), tamoxifen is capable of causing cancer of the vagina (24,25).
p424
aVOther possible mechanisms for the uterine carcinogenicity of tamoxifen could involve hormonal imprinting (26), in this case neonatally, or a small but particularly effective genotoxic action, inducing DNA adducts, in a stem cell population at a crucial stage prior to uterine glandular development.
p425
aVIt was notable that the tamoxifen-induced uterine adenocarcinomas in rats arose in the same time span as the control uterine cancers.
p426
aVThis would imply that transformed stem cells or stem cells subject to abnormal hormonal imprinting are latent for expression of their full oncogenic potential.
p427
aVWhen the same promoting factors become available to them, as act in control animals, this would allow expression of the latent abnormality causing development of uterine adenocarcinomas late in their lifespan.
p428
aVHormonal imprinting has recently been implicated in the increased incidence of a rare rete testis carcinoma found in mice treated in utero with DES (26).
p429
aVA similar mechanism could explain the development of endometrial cancer in women taking tamoxifen.
p430
aVIt is interesting to compare these data with a recent study which used nitrosamine initiation in the uteri of mice and then attempted to promote the initiated cells using the agonist effect of tamoxifen, which occurs in the sexually mature mouse (27).
p431
aVThis attempt, even with initiated cells present, only produced an increase in the incidence of preneoplastic lesions of the endometrium and not adenocarcinomas, as occurred in a treatment group using oestradiol in the same study (27).
p432
aVThe only other experimental induction of endometrial cancers using tamoxifen has been the treatment of neonatal mice with this drug on days 1\u20135 after birth.
p433
aVThis resulted in an incidence of up to 50% of adenocarcinomas of the uterus between 14 and 17 months later (28).
p434
aVThis occurred in the presence of evidence of an oestrogen agonist effect after treatment,
p435
aVwhich is consistent with the known effect of tamoxifen to act as an oestrogen agonist in the uterus of the sexually mature mouse.
p436
aVTamoxifen has been shown to induce ER expression in luminal epithelial cells of the neonatal mouse, at a time when this expression is not normally apparent (29),
p437
aVindicating a possible hormonal imprinting effect on ER expression and perhaps subsequent function.
p438
aVClearly, the great sensitivity of the neonatal rodent to the carcinogenic potential of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and drugs makes them ideal for studying this process, independently of concerns over whether or not the compounds are agonists or antagonists of oestrogen action, in the reproductive tract.
p439
aVThe present data indicate that tamoxifen is able to induce cancers of the uterus and vagina in the rat, even when there is no oestrogen agonist effect evident, which must give cause for concern over its use as a chemopreventative agent, whatever mechanism is responsible.
p440
aVHormonal imprinting has been suggested to be a possible mechanistic factor in the increased incidence of a rare rete testis carcinoma found in mice treated in utero with DES (26) and may also be involved in the induction of mouse uterine adenocarcinomas by tamoxifen (28).
p441
aVA similar mechanism could contribute to the development of endometrial and vaginal cancers in rats.
p442
aVAs we have shown previously [Tardieu,D., Jaeg,J.P., Cadet,J., Embvani,E., Corpet,D.E.
p443
aVand Petit,C.
p444
aV(1998) Cancer Lett, 134, 1\u20135], a 48-h treatment of 6% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in drinking water led to a reproducible 2-fold increase of the mutagenic oxidative lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) in colonic mucosa DNA of rats in vivo.
p445
aVThe aim of this study was to test the effect of nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, on the DSS-induced 8-oxodGuo increase.
p446
aVWe show that nimesulide when administered orally, simultaneously with DSS at 5 mg/kg/day, not only totally prevents 8-oxodGuo formation but also suppresses the 5-fold increase of superoxide induced by DSS in the colonic mucosa.
p447
aVThis was measured by in vivo formazan blue precipitation (P &lt; 0.01 in the Wilcoxon test).
p448
aVMoreover, nimesulide enhances apoptosis by ~30% as compared with the already high level induced by DSS treatment (P &lt; 0.01).
p449
aVIt is suggested that the significant increase in mutagenic oxidative DNA damage, produced by mild acute colonic inflammation, could be important in the initiation of colon cancer in both animals and man.
p450
aVThese effects may explain at least partly the well-documented protective action towards colon cancer by preferential COX-2 inhibitors, either xenobiotics such as nimesulide or natural nutrients.
p451
aVThere is evidence that oxidative stress may be involved in the initiation and promotion of colon carcinogenesis (1\u20133), as well as in cancers from other organs.
p452
aVAmong the factors involved in oxidative events leading to DNA damage in colonocytes, inflammation may be important, which is attested by at least three facts.
p453
aV(i) Chronic colitis leads to an increased frequency of colon cancers in animals and humans (4,5).
p454
aV(ii) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) protect man against colon cancer by ~2-fold and COX-2 selective reduces by 50% the cancer incidence in rats (6\u20138).
p455
aV(iii) As we have shown previously, even a mild acute inflammation can double the amount of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) in the DNA of rat colonic mucosa within 48 h (9).
p456
aVIn addition, the role of oxidative DNA damage has been recently emphasized as a major mutagenic event in eukaryotic cell (10).
p457
aVNimesulide, a NSAID that is both a preferential COX-2 inhibitor (11\u201313) and at higher concentrations, an antioxidant (14), is able to suppress the promotion of colonic aberrant crypt foci (15), intestinal polyps (16) or colonic tumours (17) in rats.
p458
aVHence, we wished to know whether nimesulide could prevent early oxidative DNA damage and superoxide formation in rat colonic mucosa in vivo under inflammatory conditions.
p459
aVWe show here that nimesulide completely suppresses the increase of 8-oxodGuo, a mutagenic oxidative DNA damage observed during the early dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced inflammation.
p460
aVThis may both explain the protective role of NSAID towards colon cancer and suggest a role of mild acute inflammation in colonic genotoxicity.
p461
aVSixty-six female, 4-week-old, Fisher 344 rats (Iffa credo, Lyon, France), were acclimatized for 12 days to the animal colony, fed ad libitum a low fat rodent chow (UAR, Villemoisson, France) and randomized to three groups of 22 rats (six animals in one cage).
p462
aVA control group was given drinking water ad libitum.
p463
aVTwo experimental groups received 6% DSS (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora OH) in distilled drinking water for 2 days (`DSS-treated group').
p464
aVOne of these groups received 5 mg/kg per os nimesulide (Novartis Santé Animale, Rueil-Malmaison, France) in drinking water 1 day before and during the DSS treatment.
p465
aVAnimals were killed 2 days after the start of DSS administration by cervical dislocation.
p466
aVThe rat colons (10 animals in each group) were dissected between ileocaecal junction and the proximal rectum, placed on a non-absorbent surface, and flushed with cold NaCl 0.9% (4°C).
p467
aVThe colons were opened longitudinally and the mucosa removed by scratching the distal surface with a lancet blade (5 cm at the rectal end).
p468
aVThe samples were rinsed with NaCl 0.9% and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min.
p469
aVThe pellets were immediately frozen individually at \u201380°C for the 8-oxodGuo assay, which was performed within 2 days.
p470
aVThe Quiagen kit genomic DNA (Quiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) was used to extract DNA at ambient temperature from cellular pellets.
p471
aVAfter homogenization with a potter, the samples were treated with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) at 50°C for 2 h in buffer G2 (800 mM guanidine\u2013HCl, 30 mM EDTA, 30 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 5% Tween-20, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0).
p472
aVLysates (10 ml) were then applied to the equilibrated (750 mM NaCl, 50 mM MOPS, 0.15% Triton X-100, pH 7) Quiagen genomic tips.
p473
aVAfter washing tips with QC buffer (1.0 M NaCl, 50 mM MOPS, 15% ethanol, pH 7.0), the purified genomic DNA was eluted with QF buffer (1.25 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 15% ethanol, pH 8.5).
p474
aVThe DNA was precipitated by 2-propanol, washed with 70% ethanol, air dried and diluted in 100 \u03bcl sterile water before analysis.
p475
aVDNA in aqueous solution was hydrolysed to nucleotides using 10 U nuclease P1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) for 2 h at 37°C in acetate buffer (pH 5.3) according to Floyd (18).

aVDephosphorylation was achieved using 2 U alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37°C.
p477
aVProteins were precipitated with chloroform and the aqueous layer was analysed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical (EC) detection.
p478
aVThe HPLC system consisted of a pump (M 2200, Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany); an autosampler 738 (ICS, Toulouse, France) equipped with a 12.5×4.6 mm Spherisorb ODS 2 column (Bischoff); a detector focus (Spectra-Physics, Les Ulis, France) set at 280 nm.

aVAn isocratic eluent, 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 10% methanol, was used at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.
p481
aVOxidative DNA damage was quantified with the software PIC 3 (ICS) using calibration curves realized with authentic standards (Sigma-Aldrich).
p482
aVMyeloperoxydase (MPO), a polymorphonuclear neutrophil marker, was assessed in colon samples (six in each group) according to a method modified from Bradley et al.
p483
aV(19).
p484
aVColons were homogenized on ice in 2 ml 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6) for 30 s using an ultraturrax.
p485
aVThree cycles of freeze\u2013thaw in liquid nitrogen were realized.
p486
aVSuspensions were then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4°C.
p487
aVPellets were resuspended with 500 \u03bcl hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide buffer (0.5% HTAB, w/v in phosphate buffer, pH 6) in order to release MPO from the polymorphonuclear neutrophil granules.
p488
aVSamples were sonicated for 30 s at 4°C and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4°C.
p489
aVAn aliquot of 50 \u03bcl supernatant from each sample was used to determine protein concentration by the Bradford method (Biorad, Ivry sur Seine, France) and the samples were assayed for MPO activity by visible spectrophotometry.
p490
aVSamples were diluted in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.167 mg/ml of O-dianisidine dihydrochloride and 0.0005% of hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich).
p491
aVAbsorbency at 450 nm was recorded during 2 min with an Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer (Kontron instruments, St Quentin en Yvelines, France).
p492
aVMPO from human neutrophils was used as a reference and MPO activity was expressed as MPO U/mg protein.

aVDetection of superoxide was performed using the method described by Hagen et al.
p494
aV(20) to assay superoxide in liver using a nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) perfusion.
p495
aVIn the presence of superoxide, NBT forms insoluble blue formazan precipitates within the tissues.
p496
aVThe method was adapted as follows.
p497
aVThe animals (six in each group) were anaesthetized with chloroform, a midline laparotomy was realized and a solution of 8 ml 1% NBT in NaCl 0.9% at 37°C containing 0.2 U/ml heparin was slowly (within 2 min) perfused in the dorsal aorta.
p498
aVThis was followed by a perfusion of 8 ml NaCl 0.9% at 37°C.
p499
aVThe animals were killed immediately, the colons were dissected between ileocaecal junction and the proximal rectum and placed on a non-absorbent surface.
p500
aVThey were then flushed with cold NaCl 0.9% (4°C) and fixed in PBS\u2013formalin.
p501
aVParaffin-embedded slices were stained by haematoxylin\u2013eosin for histological examination.
p502
aVThe counting of the precipitates was performed in situ by light microscopy under a magnification of ×400, using a Malassez grid to estimate the surface of mucosa.
p503
aVA total of ~270 mm2 colonic mucosa was counted for each rat and the results were standardized as number of cells containing formazan precipitates/100 mm2 of sliced mucosa.
p504
aVTo determine the relative number of apoptotic nuclei, we used the TdT-Frag EL DNA fragmentation detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Oncogene research products, Cambridge, USA).
p505
aVThe animals (six in each group) were different from those used for superoxide detection in order to avoid possible interaction with NBT.
p506
aVLongitudinal sections of paraffin-embedded colons were treated with 20 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8) for 20 min at room temperature and rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (1× TBS, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl).
p507
aVEndogenous peroxidases were inactivated by immersion in 3% H2O2 for 5 min, followed by a TBS wash.
p508
aVSamples were then labelled by incubating with TdT labelling reaction mixture for 1.5 h at 37°C.
p509
aVThe detection reaction was started by an incubation of 10 min with a blocking buffer, followed by another incubation with a diaminobenzidine\u2013H2O2\u2013urea solution for 10 min.
p510
aVThe specimens were finally counter-stained with a methyl green solution.
p511
aVFor each section all crypt units were examined and the results were expressed as the number of apoptotic nucleus/100 mm2 of mucosa.
p512
aVPositive and negative controls were performed, and the morphology of the apoptotic nuclei was checked using histological analysis.
p513
aVThe counting was performed using the same method as described above for formazan precipitates.
p514
aVData were first analysed using one-way analysis of variance, then the Student's t-test (8-oxodGuo measurement) or Wilcoxon test (others) were used to compare experimental and control group means.
p515
aVAs we have described in a previous, independent experiment (9), 8-oxodGuo content in colonic enterocyte DNA was increased 50% in DSS-treated rats as compared with the control.
p516
aVNimesulide treatment reset the 8-oxodGuo content to control levels (Figure 1), indicating a complete protective effect against oxidative DNA damage: although DSS-induced diarrhoea was not alleviated (not shown).
p517
aVMPO activity reflects the migration of polymorphonuclear cells leading to the chronic phase of inflammation (19).
p518
aVIn our conditions, the MPO measurement did not show any significant difference between the three groups (0.47, 0.47 and 0.48 U MPO/mg protein for control, DSS and DSS + nimesulide, respectively).
p519
aVThis suggests that, due to the short treatment duration, no, or very little, migration of polynuclear cells occurred at the site of inflammation.
p520
aVIn addition, the amount of white cells in the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated rats was not significantly increased as appreciated by histology.
p521
aVThe degree of inflammation that we obtained in our conditions can thus be described as acute since histopathological signs of inflammation were present (not shown).
p522
aVNBT specifically forms insoluble formazan blue precipitates in the presence of superoxide
p523
aV(20).
p524
aVIn the colon of rats, NBT perfusion led to formazan precipitates, strictly localized inside the goblet cells of the colonic mucosa (Figure 2).
p525
aVWhile those precipitates were rarely observed in control animals, their number was increased 5-fold in DSS-treated rats.
p526
aVNimesulide treatment reduced the number of precipitates to 1.5 times the background, which was not significantly different from the control value in the Wilcoxon test (Table I).
p527
aVSince COX-2 inhibitors have been found to modulate apoptosis
p528
aV(21,22), we wished to know what were their effects in colonic mucosa under early acute inflammatory conditions.
p529
aVApoptosis was rarely observed in the colonic mucosa of control animals.
p530
aVThe number of apoptotic cells dramatically increased in DSS-treated rats, and was further significantly increased by another 30% in nimesulide-treated animals (Table I).
p531
aVIn this study we wished to know whether DSS-induced oxidative DNA damage in colonocytes in vivo was prevented by the COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide.
p532
aVSince we found the answer to be clearly positive, we eventually assayed superoxide formation and showed that it was induced by DSS and was returned to the control level by the NSAID.
p533
aVFinally, we tested apoptosis in colonic mucosa and found that it was further increased by nimesulide even in inflammatory conditions.
p534
aVDSS is an extensively studied model for both acute and chronic colon inflammations, depending on the dose and treatment length (23).
p535
aVIt has long been shown to induce colon cancer in rats (24).
p536
aVIn our conditions, DSS produced a moderate inflammation, along with mild diarrhoea within 48 h. Early acute inflammatory conditions did not lead to significant migration of polynuclear cells, nor MPO concentration increase in the colon.
p537
aVHowever, the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated rats was significantly inflamed, and histological examination showed erosions in the mucosa, mild vessel dilatation and mild oedema (not shown).
p538
aVFurthermore, it has recently been shown that COX-2 was induced in the colon under inflammatory condition (25).
p539
aVThe mild acute inflammation induced by DSS led to a doubling of 8-oxodGuo concentration in colonocytes DNA, as we have shown both previously (9) and in this work.
p540
aVAn identical 2-fold increase was documented by other workers in human gastric mucosa infected by Helicobacter pylori (26) or in lungs of cigarette smokers (27), two cancer-prone situations in which a role for oxidative DNA damage has been suggested.
p541
aVIn the gastritis induced by Helicobacter, COX-2 is induced also (28).
p542
aVIt has been demonstrated that 8-oxodGuo is a highly mutagenic lesion leading to transversions GC-TA (10).
p543
aVIn the yeast Saccharomyces, a deletion of the OGG1 gene coding for the glycosylase responsible for the repair of 8-oxodGuo leads to a strong increase of transversions, even in normal culture conditions (29).
p544
aVHence, 8-oxodGuo is virtually able to play a role in mutagenic events linked to both cancer initiation and promotion.
p545
aVThe DSS-induced 8-oxodGuo formation in colonic mucosa was accompanied by oxidative stress as measured by superoxide-precipitated formazan blue, that was about five times higher in DSS-treated rats and returned nearby the basal level through NSAID treatment.
p546
aVWe observed the same protection with another NSAID, olsalazine (unpublished data).
p547
aVIt is thus likely that early oxidative DNA damage is somehow linked with superoxide formation in the colonic mucosa independently from polynuclear migration that would occur later in the chronic state.
p548
aVFinally, apoptosis was dramatically enhanced by DSS treatment, and nimesulide led to a further enhancement that was similarly observed with olsalazine (not shown).
p549
aVApoptosis enhancement may have a beneficial consequence for eliminating heavily damaged mutation-prone cells in which DNA repair runs the risk of being suppressed.
p550
aVAlthough an increase in apoptosis linked to COX-2 inhibition has already been documented in colonic cells it was in non-inflammatory conditions (21,30).
p551
aVTaken together, our data suggest that early acute inflammation, independent from the accumulation of polynuclear cells, is able to induce significant oxidative stress in colonic mucosa leading to oxidative DNA damage.
p552
aVA NSAID such as nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, alleviates the oxidative events and stimulates apoptosis.
p553
aVAlthough it is not clear at this time whether the protection by nimesulide is primarily due to the inhibition of COX-2 or some associated mechanism(s), such as malondialdehyde formation (22), the overall results could explain at least partly the protection by nimesulide-like molecules against colon carcinogenesis.
p554
aVFurthermore, our present data support the fact that mild inflammation may be an under-estimated risk factor for colon carcinogenesis.
p555
aVThe protective role played by natural antioxidants in diets, such as green tea (31\u201333), flavonoids (3) or that of natural COX-2 inhibitors such as curcumin (34), berberine (35) or resveratrol (36), may possibly be understood in this respect.
p556
aVIt is also noteworthy that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are likely cyclooxygenase inhibitors (37\u201339), both protect against aberrant crypt foci promotion and induce apoptosis in rats (40).
p557
aVBronchiolo-alveolar tumors were observed in mice exposed chronically to 160 ppm styrene, whereas no tumors were seen in rats up to concentrations of 1000 ppm.
p558
aVClara cells, which are predominant in the bronchiolo-alveolar region in mouse lungs but less numerous in rat and human lung, contain various cytochrome P450s, which may oxidize styrene to the rodent carcinogen styrene-7,8-oxide (SO) and other reactive metabolites.
p559
aVReactive metabolites may form specific DNA adducts and induce the tumors observed in mice.
p560
aVTo determine DNA adducts in specific tissues and cell types, rats and mice were exposed to 160 ppm [ring-U-14C]styrene by nose-only inhalation for 6 h in a recirculating exposure system.
p561
aVLiver and lungs were isolated and 42 h after exposure.
p562
aVFractions enriched in Type II cells and Clara cells were isolated from rat and mouse lung, respectively.
p563
aVDNA adduct profiles differed quantitatively and qualitatively in liver, total lung, and enriched lung cell fractions.
p564
aVAt and 42 h after exposure, the two isomeric N7-guanine adducts of SO (measured together, HPEG) were present in liver at 3.0 ± 0.2 and 1.9 ± 0.3 (rat) and 1.2 ± 0.2 and 3.2 ± 0.5 (mouse) per 108 bases.
p565
aVSeveral other, unidentified adducts were present at two to three times higher concentrations in mouse, but not in rat liver.
p566
aVIn both rat and mouse lung, HPEG was the major adduct at \u223c1 per 108 bases at h, and these levels halved at 42 h. In both rat Type II and non-Type II cells, HPEG was the major adduct and was about three times higher in Type II cells than in total lung.
p567
aVFor mice, DNA adduct levels in Clara cells and non-Clara cells were similar to total lung.
p568
aVThe hepatic covalent binding index (CBI) at and 42 h was 0.19 ± 0.06 and 0.14 ± 0.03 (rat) and 0.25 ± 0.11 and 0.44 ± 0.23 (mouse), respectively.
p569
aVThe pulmonary CBIs, based on tissues combined for and 42 h, were 0.17 ± 0.04 (rat) and 0.24 ± 0.04 (mouse).
p570
aVCompared with CBIs for other genotoxicants, these values indicate that styrene has only very weak adduct-forming potency.
p571
aVThe overall results of this study indicate that DNA adduct formation does not play an important role in styrene tumorigenicity in chronically exposed mice.
p572
aVStyrene is an important industrial chemical used for the production of reinforced plastics and various polymers.
p573
aVReview of 11 long-term toxicity studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of styrene led to the conclusion that there was no convincing evidence of carcinogenic activity of styrene in animals, although some of the studies were considered inadequate (McConnell and Swenberg, 1994).
p574
aVRecent state-of-the-art carcinogenicity studies in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to styrene for 2 years via inhalation revealed an increased incidence of masses in the bronchiolo-alveolar region in the lungs of mice exposed to 160 ppm styrene, but no increases in tumor incidence in rats exposed to up to 1000 ppm styrene (Cruzan et al., 1998, in press).
p575
aVIn 1994, IARC concluded that there was inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of styrene.
p576
aVNevertheless, styrene was classified as a Type 2B carcinogen, i.e., a possible human carcinogen, because it is extensively metabolized in human and animal tissues to the genotoxic metabolite styrene-7,8-oxide (SO) (IARC, 1994a,IARC, 1994b).
p577
aVHowever, the concentration of SO or other reactive metabolites available for macromolecular binding will be the net result of formation and subsequent detoxification reactions.
p578
aVSO is rapidly detoxified to more water-soluble compounds and excreted in the urine.
p579
aVIn this study, approximately 95% and 85% of the styrene retained upon inhalation was excreted as urinary metabolites by rats and mice, respectively (Boogaard et al., 2000).
p580
aVAs depicted in Figure 1, important routes of detoxification of SO are glutathione conjugation, eventually leading to the urinary excretion of the corresponding mercapturic acids, and epoxide hydrolysis, eventually leading to the urinary excretion of mandelic, phenylglyoxylic, and hippuric acid.
p581
aVQuantitatively, the glutathione pathway was equally important in rats and mice, accounting for about a quarter of the total urinary metabolites in the present study (data not shown), whereas the EH pathway accounted for 63% and 31% of total urinary metabolites in rats and mice, respectively.
p582
aVThe excretion of phenylaceturic acid,
p583
aVprobably derived from phenylacetaldehyde,
p584
aVwas also an important pathway in mice, accounting for 22% of the total urinary metabolites, whereas in rats phenylaceturic acid accounted for only 3% of the total urinary metabolites.
p585
aVIn some cases lung selective injury is simply related to the levels of toxicant reaching the respiratory tract.
p586
aVThe apparent levels of microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in both animal and human lungs are less than 10% of those present in the liver (Bond, 1993).
p587
aVNevertheless, the highly focal localization of these enzymes to only a few of the many cell types within the lung predisposes these cells to a disproportionate susceptibility to chemicals that undergo metabolic activation.
p588
aVThis may also apply to styrene, as metabolic activation to SO has often been considered to be responsible for its carcinogenic effects (Phillips and Farmer, 1994).
p589
aVAlternatively, ringoxidation of styrene or SO (see Fig.
p590
aV1), catalyzed by specific isoforms of cytochrome P450, which might subsequently lead to reactive ringopened products, might explain the susceptibility differences.
p591
aVEvidence for pathways involving ringopening of styrene, accounting for up to 10% of the metabolism of styrene in mice but almost absent in rats, has been reported (Sumner et al., 1995).
p592
aVClara cells in mouse lung and Type II cells in rat lung are considered to be responsible for a significant proportion of the oxidative metabolizing capacity of this tissue (Pinkerton et al., 1997).
p593
aVClara cells, the target cells for styrene-induced pneumotoxicity (Cruzan et al., 1997), are a predominant cell type in mouse lung but not in rat lung.
p594
aVIn human lung, nonciliated cells are present in the bronchiolar epithelium, but the morphology of these cells differs significantly from the Clara cell morphology seen in rodents.
p595
aVThe most striking difference is the low proportion of agranular endoplasmatic reticulum, which accounts for 55 ± 8% and 66 ± 10% of the cellular components in mouse and rat Clara cells, but for only 3.1 ± 3.5% in human nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells (Pinkerton et al., 1997).
p596
aVTherefore, an important question to answer is whether the effects of styrene observed in mouse lungs are relevant for humans.
p597
aVIn the mechanistic studies described here, we investigated the covalent binding of styrene metabolites to DNA in mouse Clara cells and in rat Type II cells to provide information to assist in understanding the causes of the sensitivity of the mouse to the effects of styrene and help determine the relevance of the effects in mice for human risk assessment.
p598
aVIn the past, in vivo experiments with radiolabeled styrene and SO demonstrated in rodents that both compounds cause a low level of DNA binding (reviewed by Phillips and Farmer, 1994).
p599
aVFollowing ip administration of styrene, the two regio-isomers of the N7-guanine alkylation product of SO, N7-(2-hydroxy-1-phenylethyl)guanine and N7-(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)guanine (HPEG), were the main DNA adducts formed, whereas the corresponding N2- and O6-guanine adducts were formed in much lower concentrations (Byfält-Nordqvist et al., 1985; Pauwels et al., 1996).
p600
aVIn vitro reactions of SO with DNA or nucleosides also results in HPEG as the major adduct, but several other minor adducts, such as the N2- and O6-guanine and the N6-adenine adducts of SO, were also found (reviewed by Phillips and Farmer, 1994, and Segerbäck, 1994).
p601
aVTo the best of our knowledge, adducts from styrene metabolites other than SO have never been reported.
p602
aVIn the present study, styrene with a high specific radioactivity was used, which enabled detection of DNA adducts without any preselection at a level of approximately one adduct per 108 nucleotides in a sample of 1 mg DNA.
p603
aVStyrene (CAS no.

aV100-42-5) is a flammable, toxic agent.
p605
aVVentilation, both local and general, must be utilized as necessary to minimize exposure to styrene.
p606
aVMinimum standard protective apparel and equipment for work with styrene includes disposable, chemical-resistant gloves, laboratory coats, and safety glasses with side shields.

aVThe animals were subsequently housed in metabolism chambers for 48 h. Rats were housed individually and mice in groups of five animals per chamber.
p724
aVAfter 48 h the animals were anesthetized with a lethal dose (1 ml/kg body weight) of pentobarbital (60 mg/ml) in saline.
p725
aVOnce under deep anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was opened, and the animals were bled by collection of blood from the abdominal aorta.
p726
aVLivers and lungs were harvested for DNA isolation, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at \u201380°C until analysis.
p727
aVMice were anesthetized with a lethal dose (1 ml/kg body weight) of a solution of pentobarbital (60 mg/ml) and lithium heparin (300 IU/ml) in saline.
p728
aVOnce under deep anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was opened, and the animals were bled.
p729
aVThe liver and other abdominal organs were removed without puncturing the diaphragm.
p730
aVThe liver was snap-frozen in liquid N2 and subsequently stored at \u201380°C.
p731
aVThe skin was removed from abdomen to throat and the trachea exposed.
p732
aVA Luer cannula (no.
p733
aV200/300/030, Portex Ltd., Hythe, UK) was tied into the trachea through a small incision at its top.
p734
aVThe diaphragm was punctured carefully by means of a small incision just below the xiphisternum to deflate the lungs and subsequently removed.
p735
aVThe rib cage over the lungs and heart was removed, and the lungs were perfused via the pulmonary artery with PBS through the right ventricle using a syringe.
p736
aVExcess fluid was allowed to flow out through a cut in the left atrium.
p737
aVPerfusion of the lungs was performed with concomitant ventilation through the tracheal cannula using a syringe until they were fully perfused from blood.
p738
aVThe lungs and heart were then dissected free from the cavity.
p739
aVThe heart, esophagus, and excess tissue were removed.
p740
aVThe lungs were lavaged five times with PBS to remove macrophages and secretions and once with 0.25% crystalline trypsin in Solution I (133 mM NaCl, 10.3 mM HEPES, 5.6 mM glucose, 5.2 mM KCl, 1.89 mM CaCl2, and 1.29 mM MgSO4 in 2.59 mM phosphate buffer, adjusted to pH 7.40).
p741
aVThe cells from the combined lavage fluid fractions were collected by centrifugation (2500 g for 10 min at 4°C), snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at \u201380°C.
p742
aVSubsequently, a clean syringe was attached to the trachea cannula, and the lungs were filled completely with fresh 0.25% crystalline trypsin in Solution I to expand all lobes fully.
p743
aVThe lungs were suspended in PBS kept at 37°C in a waterbath for about 20 min, during which time the trypsin solution was constantly topped up.
p744
aVAfter 20 min, the lungs were transferred into a Petri dish, the trachea and main bronchi were removed, and the parenchymal tissue was chopped into 1- to 2-mm cubes in 1 ml fetal calf serum (FCS) and 3 ml of 0.025% (w/v) DNase I in Solution II (133 mM NaCl, 10.3 mM HEPES, 5.6 mM glucose, and 5.2 mM KCl in 2.59 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.40) per lung using two pairs of scissors.
p745
aVThe suspension was transferred using a serum pipette to a 50-ml tube and inverted repeatedly for 2 min by hand.
p746
aVThe suspension was then sequentially filtered through a 150-\u03bcm and a 30-\u03bcm nylon filter.
p747
aVFinally, the filtrate was centrifuged at 32 g for 6 min at 10°C to collect Clara cells at the bottom of the tube.
p748
aVThe supernatant was centrifuged twice more at 32 g for 6 min at 10°C.
p749
aVThe three Clara cell-enriched fractions were combined, washed with PBS, and snap-frozen in liquid N2 after taking a small sample for staining (Clara cells).
p750
aVThe cells that remained in the supernatant were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with PBS, and snap-frozen in liquid N2 (non-Clara cells).
p751
aVThe frozen cells were stored at \u201380°C until analysis.
p752
aVThe first part of the procedure was identical to that described for mice, except that a larger Luer cannula (no.
p753
aV200/300/050) was tied in the trachea.
p754
aVFollowing lavage, a clean syringe was attached to the trachea cannula, and the lungs were filled completely with fresh 0.25% crystalline trypsin in Solution I to expand all lobes fully.
p755
aVThe lungs were suspended in PBS kept at 37°C in a waterbath for about 30 min, during which time the trypsin solution was constantly topped up.
p756
aVAfter 30 min, the lungs were transferred into a Petri dish, the trachea and main bronchi were removed, and the parenchymal tissue was chopped into 1- to 2-mm cubes in 5 ml fetal calf serum and 15 ml 0.025% (w/v) DNase I in Solution II per lung using two pair of scissors.
p757
aVThe suspension was transferred using a serum pipette to a 50-ml tube and shaken by hand for 4 min in a water bath at 37°C.
p758
aVThe suspension was subsequently filtered through a 150-\u03bcm and a 30-\u03bcm nylon filter.
p759
aVTen milliliters of a heavy Percoll solution (1.089 g/l), prepared by mixing 1.0 ml of a 10× concentrated Solution I, 100 \u03bcl of fetal calf serum, 6.5 ml Percoll, and 2.4 ml purified water, was brought into a 50-ml tube.
p760
aVTen ml of a light Percoll solution (1.040 g/l), prepared by mixing 1.0 ml of a 10 times concentrated Solution I, 100 \u03bcl of fetal calf serum, 2.7 ml Percoll, and 6.2 ml purified water, was carefully layered on top.
p761
aVThe crude cell suspension was layered on top of the light Percoll solution and centrifuged at 250 g for 20 min at 10°C.
p762
aVType II cells gathered at the intersection of the heavy and light Percoll solution.
p763
aVThe Type II cell-enriched fraction was collected, washed with PBS, and snap-frozen in liquid N2 after taking a small sample for staining (Type II cells).
p764
aVThe Percoll solutions were diluted with an equal volume of PBS, and the remaining cells, depleted from Type II cells, were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with PBS, and snap-frozen in liquid N2 (non-Type II cells).
p765
aVThe frozen cells were stored at \u201380°C until analysis.
p766
aVThe mouse Clara cell or rat Type II cell fractions were diluted with three volumes of a 4% (w/v) solution of bovine serum albumin in PBS and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 5 min against the surface of a glass slide using a Cytospin (Shandon Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA).
p767
aVThe preparations of Clara cells were air fixed and incubated at 37°C with a drop of a 0.1% (w/v) solution of nitrotetrazolium blue in HEPES-buffered PBS and a drop of 0.1% (w/v) NADPH solution in HEPES-buffered PBS for 5 min.
p768
aVThe slides were drained and counterstained with 1% (w/v) aqueous methylene green, and blue-purple (formazan) cells were scored as Clara cells (NTB+) (Devereux and Fouts, 1980).
p769
aVThe air-fixed preparations of Type II cells were incubated with a drop of Harris hematoxylin for 3 min.
p770
aVThe slides were dipped in purified water, incubated with a aqueous lithium carbonate solution (1 volume of a saturated Li2CO3 solution diluted with 84 volumes of purified water) for 5 min, and washed with purified water again.
p771
aVCells with dark-blue granules (lamellar bodies) were scored as Type II cells (PAP+) (Kikkawa and Yoneda, 1974).
p772
aVLungs were pulverized in liquid N2 using a hammer mill (6700 Freezer/Mill, Glen Creston Inc., Stanmore, UK), liver was minced with scissors, and cells were processed as such.
p773
aVTissue or cells were homogenized using a Braun homogenizer with 20\u201325 strokes at 700 rpm in an aqueous buffer of 0.8 M guanidinium hydrochloride with RNase A (54 U/ml) and T1 (13.8 U/ml), 0.03 M TRIS base, 0.03 M ethhylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5% (w/v) Tween-20 and 0.5% (w/v) Triton-X100, adjusted with NaOH to pH 8.0 (approximately 50 ml/g tissue).
p774
aVAfter addition of 1 ml proteinase K solution (400 U/ml) per gram of tissue, the homogenized suspension was incubated for 5 h at 37°C in a shaking waterbath.
p775
aVFollowing the incubation, the suspension was stored overnight at \u201380°C.
p776
aVAnion exchange columns (Qiagen 500/G genomic tip) were washed with 10 ml equilibration buffer [0.75 M NaCl in 15% aqueous ethanol with 0.15 % (w/v) Triton-X100, buffered with 50 mM MOPS, and adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH], and 20 ml of the suspension was eluted through the column by gravity.
p777
aVThe columns were subsequently washed twice with 15 ml wash buffer (1.0 M NaCl in 15% aqueous ethanol, buffered with 50 mM MOPS, adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH) at room temperature.
p778
aVBenzoic acid, phenyl ethanol (PE), styrene glycol, and various other metabolites of styrene were completely eluted from the column using this procedure.
p779
aVFinally, the DNA was eluted from the columns with 15 ml elution buffer (1.25 M NaCl in 15% aqueous ethanol, buffered with 50 mM TRIS/HCl adjusted to pH 8.5) at 37°C.
p780
aVThe DNA was then precipitated by addition of half a volume of isopropanol and collected by centrifugation at 7800 g and 4°C for 15 min.
p781
aVThe pellet was washed with ice-cold 70% (w/v) ethanol and centrifuged once more at 7800 g and 4°C for 15 min.
p782
aVThe pellet was then lyophilized and dissolved in a small volume of purified water.
p783
aVIn contrast to more common DNA isolation methods based on phenol/chloroform extraction or hydroxyapatite column chromatography, which both leave minor impurities in the DNA, the anion exchange resin method used in this study provides highly purified DNA preparations, without any protein or metabolite contamination.
p784
aVDNA concentrations were determined in aqueous solution by UV measurements at \u03bb = 260 and 280 nm, assuming that A260 = 20.4 for a DNA solution of 1 mg/ml.
p785
aVAn aliquot of the purified DNA solution was used to determine the total radioactivity by LSC.
p786
aVDNA was prepared for analysis by NTH (Fig.
p787
aV3).
p788
aVThe DNA solution was heated to 95\u2013100°C for 1 h in a Thermomixer 5437 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and the released adducts were isolated by micro-ultrafiltration through a filter with a molecular weight cutoff of 3000 daltons (Centricon-3, Amicon).
p789
aVThe remaining depurinated DNA was washed from the filter and lyophilized (Modulyo, Edwards, Crawley, UK).
p790
aVThe dry residue was reconstituted in a small volume of purified water (approximately 5 mg DNA/ml).
p791
aVThe radioactivity in an aliquot of this solution was determined by LSC.
p792
aVThe depurinated DNA was reconstituted with purified water at a concentration of about 1 mg/ml and hydrolyzed enzymatically by subsequent treatment with an equal volume of nuclease P1 suspension (in 100 mM bis[2-hydroxymethyl]imino-tris[hydroxymethyl]methane (bis-tris) buffer pH 6.5 with 0.25 mM ZnCl2 and 2 mM MgCl2 at a final concentration 50 U/ml) for 4 h at 37°C in a shaking waterbath and a mixture and alkaline phosphatase (final concentration 6.0 U/ ml) and acid phosphatase (final concentration 0.4 U/ml) overnight at 37°C.
p793
aVThe released nucleosides were separated from the enzymes by micro-ultrafiltration (Centricon-3) (Fig.
p794
aV3).
p795
aVThe filtrates with released adducts or nucleosides were lyophilized, and the residue was dissolved in the HPLC buffer containing the nonlabeled reference standards and analyzed by HPLC (System C) with on-line UV and radioactivity detection while fractions were collected for subsequent LSC or with MS.
p796
aVFor further identification of adducts, a series of reference compounds was analyzed by the same HPLC system (System C).
p797
aVThe methylated base adducts and 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol were dissolved in 0.1 N HCl at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.
p798
aVThe phenethyl alcohols were dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 N HCl and methanol.
p799
aVThe standards were analyzed as such and as a 1:1 dilution with a solution of HPEG in the HPLC buffer.
p800
aVUnless otherwise indicated, values are arithmetic mean ± SE.
p801
aVComparisons for between-time and across-species differences were tested for statistical significance using Student's t-test.
p802
aVA probability of p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
p803
aVPublished procedures for Clara cell isolation aim at obtaining enriched Clara-cell fractions in which the number of fibroblasts is decreased and the viability increased at the expense of yield.
p804
aVThe method by Oreffo et al.
p805
aV(1990) was therefore adapted, with the most important alteration being the omission of the differential attachment procedure to reduce the number of contaminating fibroblasts.
p806
aVThis adaptation resulted in higher cell numbers (1.0 ± 0.1 (SE) × 106 cells/lung) than those obtained with the original method (0.6 ± 0.2 × 106 cells/lung) with similar purity.
p807
aVThe adapted procedure yielded 62 \u03bcg DNA/106 cells.
p808
aVBecause styrene is pneumotoxic, there is a possibility that certain cell characteristics such as specific density are altered due to the exposure to styrene.
p809
aVSuch cell alterations might seriously affect the cell isolation procedures, as they are based on specific gravity and isopycnic centrifugation.
p810
aVHowever, identical numbers of Clara cells (1.0 × 106 cells/mouse) with similar purities (60% NTB+) and Type II cells (2.4 × 106 cells/rat; 70% PAP+) were isolated from control and styrene-treated animals,
p811
aVindicating that the exposure to styrene did not affect the isolation procedures.
p812
aVNormal amounts of DNA, 1.0 ± 0.1(SE) mg and 2.3 ± 0.3 mg DNA/g for liver and lung, respectively, were isolated from rats and mice treated with 14C-styrene by ip administration.
p813
aVFor both rats and mice, the total adduct level in liver was about an order of magnitude higher than in lungs.
p814
aVFrom the data it was confirmed that the sensitivity of the method allows detection of adducts in a 1-mg sample of DNA at a concentration as low as 1 adduct/108 nucleotides using 14C-styrene with a specific radioactivity of 50 Ci/mol (1.85 TBq/mol).
p815
aVDNA was isolated from livers of rats sacrificed immediately after inhalation exposure and 42 h after cessation of exposure.
p816
aVDNA was also isolated from three of the liver pools (each from five animals) from mice killed immediately after exposure and from three of the liver pools from mice killed 42 h after exposure.
p817
aVThe radioactivity associated with the hepatic DNA from rats killed immediately after exposure was almost completely released by NTH.
p818
aVThe major adducts were the N7-guanine adducts of SO (HPEG) at a concentration of 3.0 ± 0.2 adducts/108 nucleotides in five of the animals (Fig.
p819
aV4A).
p820
aVIn one rat, a different adduct profile was found with very little of HPEG.
p821
aVIn the livers of the rats killed 42 h after exposure, HPEG was still the major adduct, but the concentration was lower (1.9 ± 0.3 adducts/108 nucleotides); the other adducts that were observed earlier had decreased to very low levels or were no longer detectable (Fig.
p822
aV4B).
p823
aVThe profile of adducts in mice was different, showing quantitative and qualitative differences from rats.
p824
aVIn addition, the time course of the adduct formation was different compared to rats:
p825
aVimmediately after exposure, total hepatic DNA adduct levels are higher than in rats (Fig.
p826
aV4C); 42 h later, the adduct levels have increased considerably (Fig.
p827
aV4D), whereas in rats the adducts almost disappeared in the same time span.
p828
aVHPEG, the major adduct in rats, was only a minor adduct in mice immediately after exposure, although the concentration 42 h after exposure (3.2 ± 0.5 adducts/108 nucleotides) was higher than in rats after 42 h. In mice, there were two major unidentified adducts immediately after exposure that eluted at \u223c31 and \u223c37 min at concentrations of 2.6 ± 1.5 and 3.8 ± 1.9 adducts/108 nucleotides, respectively (Fig.
p829
aV4C).
p830
aVHPEG represented only 1.2 ± 0.2 adducts/108 nucleotides.
p831
aVAt 42 h, the adduct eluting at \u223c37 min had increased to 8 ± 7 adducts/108 nucleotides, whereas the other major peak had decreased (Fig.
p832
aV4D).
p833
aVIn addition, one of the minor unidentified early eluting peaks had increased to about 11 ± 6 adducts/108 nucleotides.
p834
aVIn both rats and mice the concentrations of adducts released upon enzymatic hydrolysis of the recovered depurinated DNA were about an order of magnitude lower than those released and measured upon NTH.
p835
aVAgain, the adduct profiles differed between mice and rats both quantitatively and qualitatively.
p836
aVThe adducts levels in rats were too low for reliable quantification.
p837
aVThe total adduct levels in mice were higher: 2 ± 1 and 3 ± 1 adducts/108 nucleotides at and 42 h after exposure, respectively.
p838
aVFrom the total amount of adducts in liver, i.e., the sum of adducts released by NTH and enzymatic hydrolysis (total radioactivity), the covalent binding index (CBI) was calculated.
p839
aVFor rats, the CBI was 0.19 ± 0.06 (SE) and 0.14 ± 0.03 at and 42 h after cessation of exposure, respectively.
p840
aVFor mice, the CBI was 0.25 ± 0.11 and 0.44 ± 0.23 at and 42 h after exposure, respectively.
p841
aVDNA from whole lung was isolated from one rat killed immediately after exposure and from one rat killed 42 h after exposure (yields 3.1 and 5.6 mg DNA, respectively).
p842
aVFor mice, DNA was isolated from the pooled lungs from two animals killed immediately after exposure and from two animals killed at 42 h after cessation of exposure in both inhalation experiments with total yields of 1.67 and 1.76 mg DNA, respectively.
p843
aVNTH of the DNA showed very low adduct levels for both rats and mice (Fig.
p844
aV5).
p845
aVFor most peaks, the levels were too low for reliable quantification.
p846
aVIn both rat and mouse lung, the major adduct peak corresponded to HPEG at a concentration of about 1 adduct/108 nucleotides (Figs.
p847
aV5A and 5C).
p848
aVAt 42 h after exposure, this level was halved (Figs.
p849
aV5B and 5D).
p850
aVQualitatively, the adduct profiles in lung DNA resembled those for liver DNA.
p851
aVThe adduct concentrations in lung DNA that were released upon NTH were low, and, from the results observed in liver, it was expected that the levels detectable upon enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA backbone would be even lower.
p852
aVTherefore, the recovered, depurinated DNA of both rats and of all mice from the different time points were pooled prior to enzymatic hydrolysis.
p853
aVIndeed, only very low concentrations of adducts were present in the depurinated DNA.
p854
aVFrom the total amount of adducts in lungs, i.e., the sum of adducts released by neutral thermal and enzymatic hydrolysis, the covalent binding index (CBI) was calculated.
p855
aVSince the depurinated DNA was pooled for both time points, the calculated CBIs are averages from and 42 h after exposure.
p856
aVThe CBIs for rat and mouse lung were 0.17 ± 0.04 and 0.24 ± 0.04, respectively.
p857
aVOnly a relatively small number of macrophages was present in the pulmonary lavage fluid from both rats and mice.
p858
aVAs a consequence, the amounts of extracted DNA were also small (ranging from 6 to 14 \u03bcg per group), thus limiting the sensitivity of the adduct analysis.
p859
aVAlthough lymphocyte DNA was pooled for rats and for mice to increase sensitivity, the overall adduct level was low, and the profiles give no indication for any specific adduct.
p860
aVIn the first isolation (immediate sacrifice), 65 ± 6 (SE) % of the cells were PAP+, and 0.93 mg DNA was isolated.
p861
aVIn the second isolation (42 h postexposure), 73 ± 4 (SE) % of the cells were PAP+, and 1.11 mg DNA was isolated.
p862
aVHPEG was clearly present in the Type II cell DNA at a concentration of about 1 adduct/108 nucleotides immediately after exposure (Fig.
p863
aV6A) and at 2 adducts/108 nucleotides 42 h later (Fig.
p864
aV6B).
p865
aVThe yield of non-Type II cells was much lower, and only 10 and 210 \u03bcg of DNA could be isolated from the rats sacrificed at and 42 h following exposure, respectively.
p866
aVThe low yield of DNA from non-Type II cells isolated from rat lungs immediately after exposure made it impossible to accurately determine the concentration of adducts.
p867
aVThe profile, however, suggests that HPEG was present (Fig.
p868
aV6C).
p869
aVNo distinct adduct pattern was discernible in the non-Type II cells at 42 h (Fig.
p870
aV6D).
p871
aVClara cell-enriched fractions isolated immediately after exposure stained 57 ± 2 (SE) % and 61 ± 3% NTB+ for the first and second inhalation experiment, respectively.
p872
aVClara cell-enriched fractions isolated 42 h postexposure stained 70 ± 3 (SE) % and 63 ± 2% NTB+, for the first and second exposures, respectively.
p873
aVThe Clara cell fractions as well as the non-Clara cell fractions from the two inhalation experiments were pooled.
p874
aVThe DNA yield was 0.90 mg from the Clara cells and 0.45 mg from the non-Clara cells isolated from the mice killed immediately after exposure, and 1.12 and 0.17 mg from Clara and non-Clara cells isolated 42 h after exposure, respectively.
p875
aVDNA adduct concentrations in the Clara cell fractions were relatively low and comparable with the DNA adduct levels in total mouse lungs (Fig.
p876
aV7A).
p877
aVAt 42 h after exposure, the concentration of adducts was higher than immediately after exposure.
p878
aVThe major peak at 42 h, equivalent to a level of approximately 6 adducts/108 nucleotides, eluted at \u223c9 min (Fig.
p879
aV7B).
p880
aVThis same peak was very prominent in the non-Clara cell fraction at 42 h (Fig.
p881
aV7D).
p882
aVIts concentration was measured at approximately 80 adducts/108 nucleotides, but there is a large relative error (approximately 30%) associated with this value, as it was determined using a very small amount of available DNA (170 \u03bcg).
p883
aVThe retention time of the compound eluting at \u223c9 min, observed in mouse non-Clara cells and Clara cells, did not match with the retention times of depurinating methylated base adducts such as N3-methylcytosine, N3-methyladenine, or N7-methylguanine, nor with guanine or adenine, nor did these compounds co-elute with any of the other, minor peaks in the chromatograms.
p884
aVA series of styrene metabolite standards was also analyzed using the same HPLC system, and benzoic acid appeared to co-elute with the unknown compound.
p885
aVLarge amounts of DNA were isolated from the remaining liver tissue from mice.
p886
aVThe DNA was depurinated by NTH, and the adducts were collected by ultrafiltration and concentrated by lyophilization.
p887
aVThe concentrated adducts were analyzed by HPLC (System C), and the fractions with the same retention time as the unknown adduct from non-Clara cells were collected.
p888
aVThe combined fractions were concentrated by lyophilization and analyzed by LC-MS.
p889
aVMass fragments strongly indicative for benzoic acid (m/z 121) were found.
p890
aVBenzoic acid itself was not retained on the extraction columns during the DNA isolation and, if present in the tissue, would not be isolated as an impurity along with the DNA.
p891
aVThe most likely source for the benzoic acid is benzaldehyde (BA), which might form a reversible Schiff base adduct with the exocyclic amino groups of the purines in the DNA (Fig.
p892
aV8).
p893
aVTherefore, we investigated whether BA would form DNA adducts that would be stable enough to be isolated and labile enough to yield benzoic acid during NTH.
p894
aVCalf thymus DNA was reacted with BA.
p895
aVAfter removal of the unreacted BA, the DNA was isolated and purified using the standard method.
p896
aVThe precipitated DNA was lyophilized, dissolved in water, and subjected to NTH.
p897
aVIn addition, AMP was reacted with BA.
p898
aVThe reaction mixture was thoroughly extracted to remove unreacted benzaldehyde and was then subjected to NTH.
p899
aVFrom both the DNA and the AMP that had reacted with BA, benzoic acid was released and detected by HPLC-UV and LC-MS.
p900
aVInterestingly, the co-elution experiments with metabolite standards showed that two other unidentified peaks had retention times identical to two of the standards.
p901
aVFirst, in liver DNA from rats killed immediately after exposure, the peak eluting at 19 min co-eluted with 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (styrene glycol).
p902
aVSecond, the second-largest peak in liver DNA from mice killed immediately after exposure co-eluted with the phenylethanols (\u223c31 min).
p903
aVThe formation of this compound seems specific to mouse, as it was also present in livers from mice killed at 42 h and in mouse lungs (both at and 42 h) but completely absent in rat tissues.
p904
aVSeveral adverse effects have been observed in experimental animals following exposure to styrene, including hepato-, pneumo-, neuro-, and reprotoxic effects (Bond, 1989; Gadberry et al., 1996; Sumner et al., 1997).
p905
aVThe carcinogenicity of styrene is still under debate.
p906
aVAlthough the evidence for carcinogenicity in humans was considered inadequate and the evidence in animals limited, IARC classified styrene as a possible human carcinogen (2B), considering that styrene is metabolized in human and animal tissues to SO, an established genotoxicant (IARC, 1994a).
p907
aVIn a recent 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice exposed to styrene by inhalation mice were more susceptible to styrene toxicity than rats.
p908
aVMice, but not rats, developed bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas (Cruzan et al., in press).
p909
aVIn a subchronic inhalation study of styrene in rats and mice, no increase in cell proliferation was found in liver of rats or mice or in rat lung cells.
p910
aVNo increase in labeling index of Type II cells in mouse lung was seen, but an increased cell proliferation of Clara cells was observed after 2 weeks, but not after 5 and 13 weeks, at concentrations of 150 ppm and higher (Cruzan et al., 1997).
p911
aVPhillips and Farmer suggested that the adverse effects of styrene are mediated through SO (Phillips and Farmer, 1994).
p912
aVBecause SO concentrations in blood were lower in mice exposed to 160 ppm styrene than in rats exposed to 200\u20131000 ppm styrene, it is unlikely that differences in hepatic conversion of styrene to SO would be responsible for the observed effects in mouse lungs.
p913
aVHowever, styrene is also metabolized to SO in the lung.
p914
aVClara cells and Type II cells are responsible for a significant portion of the oxidative metabolizing capacity of the lung, with Clara cells being the predominant cell type in mouse lung and Type II cells in rat lung.
p915
aVRecently the styrene-metabolizing capacity was shown to be much greater in Clara cells than in Type II cells, which showed little activity towards styrene (Hynes et al., 1999).
p916
aVThe high rate of oxidation of styrene to SO in Clara cells might explain the greater susceptibility of the mouse to styrene-induced tumorigenicity.
p917
aVAnother explanation for the mouse-specific adverse effects might be given by alternative pathways in the metabolism of styrene or SO, such as ringoxidation of styrene or SO, catalyzed by specific isoforms of cytochrome P450, which might subsequently lead to reactive ringopened products.
p918
aVIn the present study we wanted to detect and quantify DNA adducts of styrene in mouse Clara cells and in rat Type II cells.
p919
aVTo the best of our knowledge, specific adducts have not previously been identified in isolated lung cells.
p920
aVThe methods used for lung cell isolations in the current study were based on published methods.
p921
aVThe methodology for the isolation of rat Type II alveolar cells was applied as reported by Richards and coworkers, as it was expected that sufficient DNA could be obtained from the isolated cells.
p922
aVIndeed, the actual yield was similar to that reported (Clouter and Richards, 1997; Richards et al., 1987).
p923
aVThe method for isolation of mouse Clara cells was based on the method by Oreffo and coworkers (1990) which was adapted to increase the yield of Clara cells without compromising purity.
p924
aVHigher yields will result in larger amounts of DNA that can be extracted and, consequently, in an increased sensitivity of the analyses, as the sensitivity is limited by the amount of DNA available for analysis.
p925
aVA number of modifications to the original method resulted in almost a doubling of the yield of Clara cells compared to the original method without a significant deterioration of purity.
p926
aVThe DNA yield from the Clara-cell\u2013enriched fractions in the actual inhalation exposure studies, however, were significantly less than in the pilot studies.
p927
aVThese relatively low yields may partly be explained by the observed toxicity in the mice exposed to styrene by inhalation.
p928
aVIn one of the pilot studies, the effects of styrene on the isolation procedure were investigated.
p929
aVThis was deemed essential because the isolation procedures are based on the specific density of the cells, which might be affected by styrene, as it is a pneumotoxicant.
p930
aVIn the pilot studies, styrene was administered at relatively high doses as an ip bolus.
p931
aVNo obvious signs of toxicity were observed in the animals following the ip administration of styrene until necropsy 5 to 7 h later.
p932
aVIn contrast, some of the mice that had been exposed to styrene by inhalation showed clear signs of toxicity immediately after exposure, despite the fact that the actual dose of styrene in the inhalation exposure was substantially less than in the ip exposure study.
p933
aVAlthough the animals that were kept for an additional 42 h seemed to recover, gross signs of toxicity such as dehydration were observed during necropsy.
p934
aVCell yields may have been affected by toxicity, thus explaining the lower yields of DNA.
p935
aVDNA adduct profiles in mice and rats differed, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, in both liver and lung, suggesting that different reactive metabolites are formed in rats and mice.
p936
aVIn both liver and lung, and in both rats and mice, most adducts were purine adducts that could be released by NTH.
p937
aVEnzymatic hydrolysis resulted in release of a few adducts at levels just above the detection limit.
p938
aVHPEG was the major adduct in livers of rats killed immediately after exposure.
p939
aVReaction of DNA with SO in vitro also resulted mainly in the formation of HPEG (\u223c90% of all adducts), and the adduct profile observed closely resembles that found in rat liver, indicating that SO is the major DNA-reactive metabolite of styrene in the rat.
p940
aVThere were no indications for the formation of the N2-guanine adduct of SO, which is the second largest reaction product of SO with double-stranded DNA in vitro (Savela et al., 1986).
p941
aVFormation of O6-guanine or N6-adenine adducts of SO, both reported as minor adducts in DNA treated with SO in vitro, was not observed in rat or mouse liver.
p942
aVHowever, based on the ratio of formation of these adducts compared to the formation of HPEG in vitro (Phillips and Farmer, 1994) and on the actual concentration of HPEG measured in the current study, it is expected that even the concentration of the N2-guanine adduct of SO, the second largest adduct of SO, would be around or just below the limit of detection.
p943
aVIn rats killed 42 h after exposure, the concentration of HPEG had decreased, but HPEG was still the major adduct.
p944
aVThe major adduct in mouse liver was not HPEG, although the levels were higher at 42 h than in rats, but three unknown adducts, suggesting that SO itself is not the major DNA-reactive metabolite from styrene in mice.
p945
aVPreliminary results of studies on the excretion of urinary metabolites by the animals of this study also point to a significant qualitative difference in the metabolism of styrene in rats and mice.
p946
aVMice excrete at least four mouse-specific metabolites, of which one accounts for 9% of the total amount of radioactivity excreted (unpublished observation).
p947
aVThe DNA adduct profiles in lung were similar to those in liver, in both rats and mice, but the adduct levels were significantly lower.
p948
aVAn adduct level in lungs that was approximately an order of magnitude lower than in liver was also observed in rats and mice dosed with 14C-styrene by ip injection, suggesting that the route of exposure is not a major determinant of the generation of DNA adduct forming metabolites in the lung.
p949
aVAlthough many adducts involving alkylation of the N7 position of guanine cause destabilization of the glycosidic bond and lead to depurination, it is not expected that spontaneous depurination has influenced the results of this study to a significant extent, as for the depurination of HPEG a half-life of approximately 10 days was found in double-strand DNA (Vodicka and Hemminki, 1988).
p950
aVSignificant amounts of adducts could not be measured in the lymphocytes isolated from the lung lavage fluid.
p951
aVAlthough the amount of DNA that could be isolated from the lymphocytes was limited, adduct levels should have been measurable if the reactive metabolites that formed adducts in the specific lung cells had been present in the general circulation.
p952
aVThis suggests that if the DNA adducts in the specific lung cells result from reactive metabolites, they must have been generated in situ in these cell types.
p953
aVThe DNA adduct levels in rat Type II as well as non-Type II cells were low.
p954
aVThe amount of DNA that could be isolated from the Type II cell-depleted fraction isolated from rats killed immediately after exposure was too low to allow quantification of the adducts.
p955
aVHowever, the radioactivity profiles suggested that HPEG might be present.
p956
aVHPEG was the major adduct in the Type II cells both and 42 h after exposure, and the levels were a few times higher than in total lung.
p957
aVThis is in agreement with the fact that Type II cells are capable of oxidation of styrene to SO.
p958
aVIn mouse Clara cells, a single unknown peak was observed as a concentration of approximately 6 adducts per 108 nucleotides at 42 h after exposure.
p959
aVSurprisingly, the same peak was also observed in the non-Clara cell fraction, but at a level of about 80 adducts per 108 nucleotides.
p960
aVBecause the Clara cell fractions are not completely pure (about 63%), it cannot be ruled out that this unknown adduct in the Clara cell fraction is due to contamination by non-Clara cells.
p961
aVAt a first consideration, it seems surprising that this peak was not observed in the total lung.
p962
aVHowever, the lungs of only two mice were used to prepare DNA to determine the adduct profile of total lung, whereas lungs of 24 mice were used to prepare DNA from the specific lung cell fractions.
p963
aVPreliminary analysis of the urine of the mice indicates that there were substantial quantitative and some qualitative interindividual differences in urinary metabolite patterns (unpublished observation).
p964
aVConsiderable variations in toxicokinetics and susceptibility to styrene in mice has also been observed by other investigators (Cruzan et al., 1997; Sumner et al., 1995, 1997).
p965
aVIt was therefore considered feasible that the unknown peak is the result of metabolism that occurred in some of the 24 mice used for preparation of the specific lung cells, but not in the 4 mice used for total lung.
p966
aVIt should be noted that this unknown peak was also present in the hepatic DNA from some of the mice killed 42 h after exposure, albeit at much lower levels.
p967
aVIn calf thymus, DNA reacted with SO; however, this peak was not detectable, indicating that it is not an adduct directly formed from SO.
p968
aVSeveral attempts were made to identify the unknown compound.
p969
aVBecause some exhaled 14CO2 could be detected, we investigated whether the unknown peak might represent a depurinating methylated base adduct, which might have been formed through degradation of the 14C-styrene and subsequent incorporation of the 14C through the S-adenosylmethionine pathway.
p970
aVIt was demonstrated that the unknown peak did not represent a depurinating methylated base.
p971
aVThe relatively short retention time of the unknown compound on reverse-phase HPLC suggests that it is rather polar in nature.
p972
aVA series of styrene metabolite standards was tested to see whether they had the same relative retention time as the unknown adduct.
p973
aVIt appeared that the unknown compound exactly co-eluted with benzoic acid.
p974
aVA large amount of hepatic DNA, isolated from mice killed 42 h after exposure, was isolated and hydrolyzed.
p975
aVFollowing semipreparative HPLC (System C) of the hydrolysate, mass fragments indicative for benzoic acid (m/z 121), were identified by LC-MS analysis in the pooled fractions corresponding to the unknown peak.
p976
aVThe most likely source for benzoic acid is benzaldehyde (BA), as BA is rapidly oxidized to benzoic acid, and we showed experimentally that BA forms a thermolabile adduct with adenine that releases benzoic acid during NTH.
p977
aVMost probably, BA forms a Schiff base adduct with the exocyclic NH2 group of adenine.
p978
aVThis adduct was stable enough to be isolated during the DNA extraction procedure, but so thermolabile that BA would be released during NTH and rapidly converted to benzoic acid (Fig.
p979
aV8).
p980
aVBA is a putative intermediate in the metabolism of styrene in the route from mandelic acid to hippuric acid (Fig.
p981
aV1).
p982
aVIt would therefore be possible that the adduct is formed from BA escaping the normal route of metabolism to benzoic acid and derived metabolites.
p983
aVHowever, both mandelic acid and hippuric acid are common metabolites of styrene in rats as well as mice.
p984
aVAlthough there are differences in metabolism between rats and mice, with rats producing significantly more hippuric acid and mice significantly more of other metabolites derived from benzoic acid, the overall flux from mandelic acid via benzylalcohol and BA to benzoic acid is quantitatively similar (unpublished observations).
p985
aVIt is feasible that the local metabolism in the lung differs between rats and mice, with mice either producing more BA or being less efficient in the detoxification of BA than rats.
p986
aVHowever, the BA adduct was not found after ip administration of 14C-styrene in either rat or mouse lungs.
p987
aVAn alternative explanation for the presence in the mouse lung cells is that the BA adduct is an artifact introduced by the styrene used for exposure.
p988
aV[ring-U-14C]-BA was the immediate precursor in the synthesis of the [ring-U-14C]-styrene used for the generation of the exposure atmosphere, and about 3% of the precursor was still present in the final product.
p989
aVThe reason that the unknown peak was not found in the pulmonary DNA of animals from the pilot study, despite the fact that the styrene used for the pilot study contained more BA (4%) than the styrene used for the main studies, may be explained by ip administration of the compound.
p990
aVIp administration ensures rapid hepatic detoxification of BA, either by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation to benzoic acid or by GSH conjugation, as the material is primarily distributed to the liver, where both the cytochrome P450 and GSH concentrations are high.
p991
aVIn mice, the presumed BA adducts were observed in the specific lung cells fractions but also in livers from mice killed 42 h after exposure at low concentrations and only in the second exposure group.
p992
aVThe most likely explanation is that the GSH in the pulmonary tissue was depleted in the mice at the end of the exposure period.
p993
aVSuch a depletion would occur more rapidly in mice, as the uptake in mice is larger than in rats.
p994
aVSuch a GSH depletion would also explain the gross signs of toxicity observed in some of the mice.
p995
aV1-Phenyl-1,2-ethanediol and phenylethanols were also among the metabolites tested to see whether they had the same relative retention time as the unknown adduct, as these compounds might have been generated through hydrolysis of a phosphate triester, formed from the attack of SO on one of the phosphate groups in the DNA, during NTH.
p996
aVHowever, 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol had a retention time of 18.3 min, and 1-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethanol had retention times of 29.4 and 29.7 min, respectively.
p997
aVIn some of the adduct profiles, peaks at the same retention time were observed.
p998
aVInterestingly, the phenethyl alcohols co-eluted exactly with an adduct peak (retention time in HPLC-LSC \u223c31 min), which was observed only in mouse, and might be derived from phenylacetaldehyde, a proposed intermediate in the metabolism of styrene (Fig.
p999
aV1).
p1000
aVFrom the total amount of radioactivity in the DNA isolated from the whole liver and lungs, the covalent binding indices (CBIs), as defined by Lutz (1979), were calculated.
p1001
aVFor rat liver, the CBIs calculated at and 42 h after exposure were 0.19 ± 0.06 and 0.14 ± 0.03, respectively.
p1002
aVThe corresponding values for mouse liver were 0.25 ± 0.11 and 0.44 ± 0.23.
p1003
aVThe CBIs for rat lungs, 0.17 ± 0.04, and mouse lungs, 0.24 ± 0.04, were similar to the CBIs calculated in the liver of both species.
p1004
aVThe values calculated for lungs include the presumed DNA adduct of BA and might thus be slightly overestimated.
p1005
aVOur results for liver corroborate the findings obtained with [7-3H]-styrene by Cantoreggi and Lutz (1993), who found CBIs for rat and mouse liver of &lt; 0.1 (detection limit) and 0.05\u20130.18, respectively.
p1006
aVCompared to CBIs for other genotoxic compounds (Lutz, 1979) and assuming that these binding values are due to monofunctional metabolites, the evidence indicates that styrene has only very weak genotoxic carcinogenic potency.
p1007
aVIn conclusion, DNA adducts were measured in whole liver, whole lung, and specific lung cells of rats and mice following nose-only exposure to 160 ppm 14C-styrene for 6 h. Qualitative differences between the nature of the adducts were observed in lungs and liver for both mouse and rats, which indicates that different reactive metabolites are formed in the two tissues and species.
p1008
aVCBIs for rat and mouse liver and lung were similar and with values less than 1, which is similar to the CBIs of compounds with only very weak genotoxic properties.
p1009
aVIn the Clara cell-depleted fractions from mouse lungs, a single adduct at relatively high concentration was measured, but there are strong indications that this adduct is an artifact caused by a radioactive impurity in the styrene exposure atmosphere.
p1010
aVThe overall results of this study demonstrate that DNA adduct formation does not play a significant role in the formation of the lung tumors that were observed in mice chronically exposed to styrene.
p1011
aVIt is more likely that a nongenotoxic or epigenetic mechanism, possibly caused by a cytotoxic metabolite, is involved in this process.
p1012
aVTrihalomethanes (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform) are regulated organic contaminants in chlorinated drinking water.
p1013
aVIn female B6C3F1 mouse liver, the 4 trihalomethanes have demonstrated carcinogenic activity when administered by oral gavage; however, chloroform was not carcinogenic when administered in drinking water.
p1014
aVFemale B6C3F1 mice were administered the trihalomethanes for 11 days by gavage at 2 dose levels or in the drinking water at \u223c75% saturation.
p1015
aVWhen
p1016
aVAND
p1017
aVadministered by gavage, the trihalomethanes were toxic to the liver, increased the liver:body weight (bw) ratio, and increased the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeling index (PCNA-LI).
p1018
aVChloroform and bromodichloromethane were the most toxic, and they increased the liver:bw ratio the most, while bromoform and chloroform increased the PCNA-LI the most.
p1019
aVWhen administered in drinking water, the toxicity of the trihalomethanes was similar to their low gavage-dose.
p1020
aVFurthermore, only chloroform significantly increased the liver:bw ratio and bromoform and chloroform increased the PCNA-LI.
p1021
aVChloroform and bromodichloromethane decreased the level of 5-methylcytosine in hepatic DNA.
p1022
aVMethylation in the promoter region of the c-myc gene was reduced by the trihalomethanes.
p1023
aVChloroform administered by gavage was more efficacious than given in drinking water; the efficacy of the other trihalomethanes did not differ for the 2 routes.
p1024
aVThus, in mouse liver, the trihalomethanes administered by gavage enhanced cell proliferation and decreased the methylation of the c-myc gene, consistent with their carcinogenic activity.
p1025
aVFurthermore, the more modest toxicity, enhancement of cell proliferation, and decreased methylation induced by chloroform administered in drinking water correlated with its lack of carcinogenic activity.
p1026
aVHence, the activity of the trihalomethanes was dependent on the rate of delivery, i.e.
p1027
aVrapid by oral gavage and more slowly in drinking water.
p1028
aVTrihalomethanes (THM), i.e., chloroform (CHCl3), bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl2), chlorodibromomethane (CHClBr2), and bromoform (CHBr3) are major organic by-products of drinking water chlorination, resulting from the reaction of chlorine with natural organic material and bromine in source waters (Uden and Miller, 1983; Coleman et al., 1984).
p1029
aVThe discovery of these by-products in drinking water has raised questions about their health hazards (Jolley et al., 1990, IARC, 1991).
p1030
aVAll four trihalomethanes, when administered by gavage, are carcinogenic in the livers of female B6C3F1 mice (NCI, 1976; NTP, 1985, 1987, 1989).
p1031
aVThe carcinogenic activity of the trihalomethanes has been proposed to be mediated through a nongenotoxic mechanism based on their weak activity in mutagenicity and genotoxicity assays (Le Cureiux et al., 1995; Reitz et al., 1990; Rosenthal et al., 1987).
p1032
aVHowever, one trihalomethane, bromodichloromethane, has demonstrated mutagenic activity apparently though a glutathione (GSH) metabolite (Pegram et al., 1997).
p1033
aVThe route of administration appears to play a significant role in the dosimetry and metabolism of the trihalomethanes and consequently in their carcinogenic and toxic activity.
p1034
aVAlthough, chloroform was carcinogenic in mice when administered by gavage, it was not carcinogenic and did not promote liver cancer when administered in the drinking water (Jorgenson, et al., 1985; Klaunig et al., 1986; Pereira et al., 1985).
p1035
aVFurthermore, cell proliferation was enhanced by chloroform administered by gavage but not given in drinking water (Larson et al., 1994; Pereira, 1994; Pereira and Grothaus, 1997).
p1036
aVThe trihalomethanes are metabolized to reactive dihalocarbonyl metabolites that react with nucleophilic compounds and macromolecules (Ammann et al., 1998; Lilly et al., 1997; Pankow et al., 1997; Pohl, 1977).
p1037
aVThus, the dihalocarbonyl metabolite of chloroform, phosgene, binds glutathione (GSH) in what appears to be a detoxifying mechanism (Ilett et al., 1973; Pohl, 1979).
p1038
aVAdministering the trihalomethanes as a bolus by gavage is expected to result in greater plasma and liver concentrations than when the same dose is delivered during the time the mice drink water.
p1039
aVThus, administering the trihalomethanes by gavage could overwhelm the ability of the liver to detoxify them, resulting in toxicity, regenerative hyperplasia, and promotion of cancer.
p1040
aVRegulation of cell proliferation is a critical facet of carcinogenesis; consequently, one mechanism proposed for nongenotoxic mouse liver carcinogens, including the trihalomethanes, is the enhancement of cell proliferation (Butterworth et al., 1992; Goodman et al., 1991; Roberts et al., 1997).
p1041
aVDecreased methylation of DNA and protooncogenes could result in decreased regulation of cell proliferation (Counts and Goodman, 1995).
p1042
aV5-Methylcytosine (5-MeC) is a naturally occurring modification of eukaryotic DNA that plays a role in the control of gene expression (Baylin et al., 1998; Kegelmeye et al., 1997; Razin and Kafri, 1994; Wolffe et al., 1999).
p1043
aVDecreased levels of 5-MeC in DNA and in specific genes are frequent early events in human and rodent tumors (Baylin et al., 1998; Bender et al., 1998; Bird et al., 1996; Pascale et al., 1993).
p1044
aVIn mouse liver, nongenotoxic carcinogens, including dichloroacetic acid (DCA), phenobarbital, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and trichloroethylene, have been shown to decrease the methylation of DNA and protooncogenes (Counts and Goodman, 1995; Counts et al., 1996; Tao et al., 1998, 1999 Tao et al., 2000).
p1045
aVThus, DNA hypomethylation has been proposed as a mechanism for nongenotoxic carcinogens and tumor promoters (Counts and Goodman, 1995).
p1046
aVThe protooncogene and cellular transcription factor, c-myc, plays a pivotal role in apoptosis, cell replication, and differentiation (Christensen et al., 1999; Holden et al., 1998).
p1047
aVThe expression of c-myc is increased in the liver during enhanced cell proliferation (Butterworth et al., 1994; Fausto and Shank, 1983; Sprankle et al., 1996; Wainfan and Poirier, 1992).
p1048
aVMethylation of CpG sites in its promoter region regulates in part the expression of its mRNA (Jones and Buckley, 1990; Razin and Kafri, 1994; Wainfan and Poirer, 1992).
p1049
aVThe methylation of the c-myc gene is decreased by a diet deficient in choline and methionine (Wainfan and Poirer, 1992) and by DCA, TCA, and trichloroethylene (Tao et al., 1999Tao et al., 2000).
p1050
aVThus, decreased methylation of the c-myc gene could be used as a biomarker for DNA hypomethylation induced by nongenotoxic carcinogens.
p1051
aVThe studies reported here compared in mouse liver the ability of the trihalomethanes to induce toxicity, to increase cell proliferation, and to decrease the methylation of the c-myc protooncogene.
p1052
aVWe also report a comparison of the activity of the trihalomethanes administered by oral gavage to their activity when administered in drinking water.

aVLiver tissue was homogenized in 0.75 ml TE buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M EDTA) containing 0.5% SDS, and the DNA isolated as previously described (Tao et al., 1998).
p1085
aVBriefly, the homogenate was treated with DNase-free RNase (400 \u03bcg/ml) and proteinase K (200 \u03bcg/ml) and then extracted 3 times with phenol, once with phenol:chloroform (1:1), and finally with chloroform.

aVThe DNA was precipitated with cold ethanol containing 10 M ammonium acetate (10% volume), washed twice with 70% ethanol, and hydrolyzed in 100 \u03bcl of 12 M perchloric acid at 100°C for 1 h. After the addition of 230 \u03bcl of 6 M KOH, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation.

aVThe supernatant filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm polypropylene syringe filter (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ) and analyzed using a Waters Model 510 HPLC system (Milford, MA) equipped with a Whatman Partisphere C18 column (4.6 × 250mm, 5 \u03bcm particle).

aVThe DNA was cross-linked by ultraviolet irradiation (UV Stratalinker Model 2400, Strategene, La Jolla, CA).

p1104
aVThe c-myc probe was designed from the GeneBank database (GeneBank accession number, M1234) to contain the 1\u20131315 bp in the promoter region of the gene.
p1105

aVStatistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat software version 2.03 (Jandel Corp., San Rafeal, CA).
p1107
aVBody and organ weights, liver:bw ratio, liver toxicity, PCNA-LI, and DNA methylation were analyzed for statistical significance by an ANOVA followed by a Tukey or Dunnett's test with a p-value &lt; 0.05.
p1108
aVWhen administered by gavage, the trihalomethanes caused dose-dependent increases in the liver:bw ratio (Fig.
p1109
aV1).
p1110
aVThe order of efficacy was chlorodibromomethane &gt; bromodichloromethane &gt; chloroform &gt; bromoform.
p1111
aVWhen administered in drinking water, only chloroform significantly increased the liver:bw ratio (Fig.
p1112
aV2).
p1113
aVEven though chloroform administered in drinking water resulted in a daily dose that was greater than the high-dose gavage (i.e., 2.83 and 2.18 mmol/kg, respectively), the increase in the liver:bw ratio was only similar to the low-dose gavage.
p1114
aVFurthermore, the other trihalomethanes did not increase the liver:bw ratio, although the daily dose resulting from the drinking water exposure was at least equal to the low-dose gavage that significantly increased the ratio.
p1115
aVAll 4 trihalomethanes were toxic to the liver; however, the toxicity of bromodichloromethane was different from the other 3.
p1116
aVThus, chloroform, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform produced liver toxicity that progressed from mid-lobular ballooning hepatocytes to necrosis extending from the central vein to the mid lobular zone, i.e., Grades 1\u20134, as described in Material and Methods.
p1117
aVIn contrast, the low dose of bromodichloromethane induced hydropic degeneration bridging between the central veins, and the high dose-induced necrosis and fibrosis with calcification and giant-cell reaction bridging between the central veins (Fig.
p1118
aV3).
p1119
aVNTP (1987) has reported that a low dose of bromodichloromethane induced degeneration and a higher dose induced necrosis, fibrosis, and microgranul-omas at the central vein.
p1120
aVThe 2 dose levels of the NTP (1987) study were similar to those used in our study.
p1121
aVThe relative toxicity of the 3 other trihalomethanes is presented in Figure 4, using the 1\u20134 grading system.
p1122
aVBromodichloromethane is not included because of the different pathogenesis of its hepatotoxicity.
p1123
aVThe toxicity of the low dose of the 3 trihalomethanes consisted of mainly mid-lobular ballooning hepatocytes (Grade 1).
p1124
aVThe high doses of chlorodibromomethane and bromoform resulted in mid- lobular ballooning hepatocytes extending to the central vein (Grade 2), and the high dose of chloroform resulted in necrosis at the central vein (Grades 3 and 4).
p1125
aVHence, necrosis was apparent only in mice administered the high dose of chloroform and bromodichloromethane, so that these 2 trihalomethanes were more toxic than chlorodibromomethane and bromoform.
p1126
aVThe toxicity resulting from the 3 trihalomethanes other than bromodichloromethane, when administered in the drinking water, is also presented in Figure 4.
p1127
aVThe toxicity of chlorodibromomethane and bromoform administered in drinking water did not differ from the low-dose gavage.
p1128
aVAlthough the daily dose resulting from chloroform administered in drinking water was greater than the high-dose gavage, it was less toxic than even the low-dose gavage.
p1129
aVThe toxicity of bromodichloromethane administered in drinking water was similar to the low-dose gavage, inducing hydropic degeneration at the central vein that in some cases was bridging between central veins.
p1130
aVThe trihalomethanes, when administered by gavage, caused a dose-dependent increase in the PCNA-LI (Fig.
p1131
aV5).
p1132
aVThe high-dose level of chloroform and bromoform resulted in the greatest increase in the PCNA-LI, followed by bromodichloromethane and chlorodibromomethane.
p1133
aVThe low-dose gavage of the trihalomethanes, with the exception of chloroform, also increased the PCNA-LI.
p1134
aVWhen administered in drinking water, the trihalomethanes increased the PCNA-LI to an extent similar to their low gavage dose (Fig.
p1135
aV6).
p1136
aVHowever, the increase was only statistically significant for chloroform and bromoform.
p1137
aVBefore determining whether the trihalomethanes decreased the methylation of the c-myc gene, the ability of the high gavage dose of chloroform and bromodichloromethane to decrease global DNA methylation was determined.
p1138
aVBoth trihalomethanes decreased global DNA methylation by about 40% (Fig.
p1139
aV7).
p1140
aVSince 2 trihalomethanes demonstrated the ability to decrease DNA methylation, it seemed reasonable to determine the ability of the trihalomethanes to decrease the methylation of a specific gene, i.e., the promoter region for the c-myc gene.
p1141
aVSouthern blots of Hpa II-digested liver DNA from mice administered the trihalomethanes contained bands of 2.7, 2.2, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.2 Kb when probed for the c-myc promoter region (Figs.
p1142
aV8 and 9).
p1143
aVThese bands were absent when the DNA was not digested with Hpa II and when DNA isolated from vehicle (corn oil and drinking water) control mice was digested with Hpa II.
p1144
aVThus, in vehicle control animals the internal cytosine of CCGG sites appears to be methylated, thereby preventing digestion by Hpa II.
p1145
aVTo demonstrate that the bands present in Hpa II digested DNA from trihalomethane-treated mice resulted from decreased methylation at CCGG sites, DNA was digested with Msp I.
p1146
aVMsp I cuts DNA irrespective of the methylation status of the internal C of CCGG sites.
p1147
aVMsp I-digested liver DNA from control mice, when probed for c-myc, resulted in a smear of radioactivity in the 100\u2013600 bp range (data not presented).
p1148
aVThis smear of radioactivity is likely the result of cuts at the 12 CCGG sites in the area probed.
p1149
aVSince the smear of radioactivity was not present after the DNA was digested with Hpa II, these sites must be methylated in control mice.
p1150
aVFurthermore, the 2.7- and 2.2-Kb bands were demonstrated to result from Hpa II cutting of the DNA at a CCGG site in the promoter region and at a site downstream from the probe.
p1151
aVWhen DNA from trihalomethane-treated mice was digested with both Hpa II and Eco0109 I, the larger bands were lost with the appearance of a 0.7-Kb band.
p1152
aVEco0109 I is a methylation-insensitive restriction enzyme that cuts PuGGNCCPy sites between the GG.
p1153
aVThe 0.7-Kb band corresponded to the distance between a CCGG site and the Eco 0109 I site in the promoter region.
p1154
aVThus, 0.7 Kb of the larger bands was demonstrated to be within the promoter region of the c-myc gene, with the rest of the band downstream from the Eco 0109 I site.
p1155
aVThe intensity of the bands present after Hpa II digestion was determined using a Scion Image Analysis System (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).
p1156
aVMethylation of the c-myc promoter decreased with the increasing dose of the trihalomethane administered by gavage.
p1157
aVThe 5 bands after Hpa II digestion exhibited similar dose-response curves.
p1158
aVTherefore, Figure 10 contains the dose-response curves for band 3 (1.0Kb),
p1159
aVchosen as representative since it is the middle band in size and the second darkest in intensity.
p1160
aVThe dose-response curves for chloroform and bromodichloromethane increased sharply between the low- and high-dose levels,
p1161
aVwhile the relationships for bromoform and chlorodibromomethane appeared convex.
p1162
aVFurthermore, chloroform and bromodichloromethane reduced the methylation of the c-myc gene more than the 2 other trihalomethanes.
p1163
aVThe intensities of the 5 bands after Hpa II digestion of DNA from mice administered the trihalomethanes in drinking water were compared, using the equivalent mmol/kg body weight dose to the dose-response relationship obtained when they were administered by gavage.
p1164
aVBecause similar results were obtained for the 5 bands, only the comparison for band 3 is presented (Fig.
p1165
aV10).
p1166
aVThe intensity of band 3 from mice exposed via their drinking water to the trihalomethanes, except for chloroform, was not different from that predicted by the dose-response relationship.
p1167
aVIn contrast, the intensity of band 3 resulting from chloroform was much less than predicted.
p1168
aVThe 4 other bands in Hpa II-digested DNA from mice administered chloroform in drinking water also had intensities that were, at most, similar to the low gavage dose (data not presented).
p1169
aVHence, although the dose resulting from chloroform in drinking water was greater than the high gavage dose, the intensity of the Hpa II digestion bands were, at most, similar to the low gavage dose.
p1170
aVThus, chloroform administered in drinking water had much less effect than when administered by gavage.
p1171
aVThe trihalomethanes are found in finished drinking water as by-products of chlorination (Uden and Miller, 1983).
p1172
aVThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1979, 1994) has set a standard for trihalomethanes in drinking water, in part because of their carcinogenic activity in laboratory animals, including liver cancer in female B6C3F1 mice (NCI, 1976; NTP, 1985, 1987, 1989).
p1173
aVHowever, the relevance to humans of the carcinogenic activity in mouse liver of the trihalomethanes, especially for chloroform, has been questioned (Pohl et al., 1979; U.S. EPA, 1979; Reitz et al., 1990).
p1174
aVIt was argued that the very weak genotoxic activity of chloroform indicates a nongenotoxic mechanism resulting from regenerative hyperplasia in response to toxicity (Butterworth et al., 1992; Reitz et al., 1990; Rosenthal, 1987).
p1175
aVToxicity, cell proliferation, and DNA methylation are all possible components of a nongenotoxic mechanism for the trihalomethanes.
p1176
aVDNA methylation can control the expression of genes including those associated with cell proliferation.
p1177
aVThe expression of c-myc has been reported to be increased by chloroform administered by gavage to B6C3F1 mice (Sprankle et al., 1996).
p1178
aVWe have also found increased expression of c-myc in mice administered chloroform by gavage as well as in the drinking water (data not presented).
p1179
aVChloroform also increased the expression of c-fos (Sprankle et al., 1996) and 4 genes identified by the differential-display technique (Kegelmeyer et al., 1997).
p1180
aVThese genes could also be hypomethylated, as suggested by the significant decrease (\u223c40%) in global DNA methylation, indicating that many genes besides c-myc are hypomethylated.
p1181
aVThus, the hypomethylation of c-myc could be an indicator of possible hypomethylation of other genes.
p1182
aVA possible mechanism for DNA hypomethylation by the trihalomethanes is to prevent, after DNA replication, the methylation of the daughter strands of DNA.
p1183
aVUnder normal conditions, there is very little cell proliferation in the liver.
p1184
aVTherefore, this mechanism requires that the trihalomethanes enhance cell proliferation in order to produce unmethylated daughter strands of DNA.
p1185
aVAll four trihalomethanes did enhance cell proliferation.
p1186
aVThe trihalomethanes could then prevent the methylation of the daughter strands of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase) or by reducing the availability of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM).
p1187
aVDNA MTase activity is increased in most tumors, including liver tumors, in the presence of DNA hypomethylation (Baylin et al., 1998; Bird et al., 1996; Jones and Buckley, 1990; Wolffe et al., 1999).
p1188
aVAlso dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acids in mouse liver decreased the methylation of the c-myc gene without decreasing DNA MTase activity (Tao et al., 2000b).
p1189
aVTherefore, it is unlikely that decreased activity of DNA MTase is the mechanism for DNA hypomethylation.
p1190
aVThe level of SAM could be reduced by liver toxicity that reduces the level of ATP required for the synthesis of SAM or by reducing the level of GSH as proposed by Lertratanangkoon et al.
p1191
aV(1997).
p1192
aVDepletion of GSH induces its synthesis, utilizing SAM for the synthesis of cysteine.
p1193
aVThe prevention of dichloroacetic acid- and trichloroacetic acid-induced hypomethylation of c-jun and c-myc genes by methionine supports this hypothesis (Tao et al., 2000a).
p1194
aVPresumably, methionine prevented the decrease in methylation by maintaining the availability of SAM.
p1195
aVHence, it is proposed that the trihalomethanes decreased DNA methylation by enhancing cell proliferation, possibly as a regenerative response to their toxicity, and then preventing the methylation of the newly synthesized daughter strands of DNA.
p1196
aVAll four trihalomethanes were toxic to the liver.
p1197
aVThe toxicity of the trihalomethanes, except for bromodichloromethane, started with ballooning hepatocytes in the mid-zone of the lobule and progressed to centrilobular necrosis.
p1198
aVHowever, in contrast to the other trihalomethanes, the toxicity induced by bromodichloromethane was mainly confined to the central lobular zone and included hydropic degeneration that progressed to centrilobular bridging necrosis, fibrosis and calcification.
p1199
aVSimilar toxicity for bromodichloromethane has been reported by NTP (1987); the low dose used in their bioassay resulted in degeneration, and the high dose resulted in necrosis, fibrosis, and the presence of microgranulomas at the central vein.
p1200
aVThe two dose levels of their bioassay were similar to those reported here.
p1201
aVBromodichloromethane has also been reported to differ from the other trihalomethanes by demonstrating mutagenic activity that required activation with GSH (Pegram et al., 1997).
p1202
aVThus, the genotoxicity and toxicity of bromodichloromethane distinguishes it from the other trihalomethanes.
p1203
aVComparison of the toxicity of the trihalomethanes to their ability to enhance cell proliferation indicated a lack of correlation.
p1204
aVAll four trihalomethanes, when administered by gavage, increased the liver:bw ratio, induced liver toxicity, and enhanced cell proliferation, i.e., the PCNA-LI.
p1205
aVBromodichloromethane and chloroform were more toxic than chlorodibromomethane and bromoform.
p1206
aVHowever, chlorodibromomethane was the most potent in increasing the liver:bw ratio followed by bromodichloromethane &gt; chloroform &gt; bromoform.
p1207
aVWith respect to the PCNA-LI, chloroform and bromoform were the most efficacious.
p1208
aVThus, the high dose of bromoform increased the PCNA-LI similarly to the high dose of chloroform although, of the four trihalomethanes, it was the weakest in increasing the liver:bw ratio and inducing toxicity.
p1209
aVAlthough both the high dose of bromoform and the low dose of chloroform were minimally toxic (Grade \u223c1.5), only bromoform increased the PCNA-LI, i.e., 25.3 ± 2.2 and 0.87 ± 0.22 for the high dose of bromoform and the low dose of chloroform, respectively.
p1210
aVThus, the ability of a trihalomethane to increase cell proliferation did not correlate with its toxicity.
p1211
aVThe effect of the trihalomethanes on the PCNA-LI also did not correlate with their effect on the liver:bw ratio.
p1212
aVThe large increase in the PCNA-LI induced by bromoform did not correlate with its limited increase in the liver/bw ratio, which could be due to its very weak toxicity, i.e.
p1213
aVinducing only mid-zonal ballooning hepatocytes.
p1214
aVIn contrast, along with their enhancement of cell proliferation, the more extensive toxicity of chloroform and bromodichloromethane could contribute to their greater increase in the liver:bw ratio.
p1215
aVFurthermore, the extensive toxicity of chloroform and bromodichloromethane is consistent with their enhancement of cell proliferation resulting from regenerative hyperplasia, while the minimal toxicity of bromoform and chlorodibromomethane indicate that they increase cell proliferation by another mechanism.
p1216
aVFor the most part, the dose-response relationships for the increase in the PCNA-LI and the decrease in the methylation of the c-myc gene by the trihalomethanes were similar.
p1217
aVThe PCNA-LI increased sharply between the low and high doses of chloroform, bromodichloromethane, and bromoform with the dose-response curve for chloroform suggesting a threshold.
p1218
aVThe dose-response curves for the ability of chloroform and bromodichloromethane to reduce the methylation of the c-myc gene also increased sharply with dose.
p1219
aVThus, the dose-response curves for the enhancement of the PCNA-LI and for the reduction in the methylation of the c-myc gene suggested that chloroform and bromodichloromethane have to overcome detoxifying mechanisms prior to exerting full activity.
p1220
aVChloroform administered in drinking water affected the liver:bw ratio, toxicity, cell proliferation, and methylation of the c-myc gene much less than when administered by gavage.
p1221
aVThe daily dose of chloroform administered in drinking water was greater than its high gavage-dose.
p1222
aVFurthermore, drinking water exposure was for seven days a week, while gavage treatment was only five days a week.
p1223
aVStill, the ability of chloroform in drinking water to increase the liver:bw ratio, induce toxicity, increase the PCNA-LI, and reduce the methylation of the c-myc gene was at most only as efficacious as its low gavage dose.
p1224
aVThis is consistent with the previously reported weaker ability of chloroform administered in the drinking water to induce toxicity and to enhance cell proliferation, compared to chloroform administered by oral gavage (Larson et al., 1994; Pereira, 1994; Pereira and Grothaus, 1997).
p1225
aVIt was also consistent with the inability of chloroform to promote liver tumors in mice when administered in drinking water at daily dose levels similar to its carcinogenic dose when administered by gavage (Jorgenson et al., 1985; Klaunig et al., 1986, Pereira et al., 1985).
p1226
aVThe weaker activity of chloroform administered in drinking water could result from its incremental delivery each time the mouse drinks, which should result in a lower liver concentration than obtained from the bolus delivered by oral gavage.
p1227
aVThe lower liver concentration of chloroform could be insufficient to overcome GSH and other detoxification mechanisms.
p1228
aVDrinking water exposure to the other three trihalomethanes resulted in daily dose levels that were similar to or slightly higher than the low dose administered by oral gavage (the greatest difference was for bromoform, i.e., 1.19 and 0.79 mmol/kg/day by drinking water and gavage, respectively).
p1229
aVDrinking water exposure affected liver:bw ratio, liver toxicity, PCNA-LI, and c-myc methylation, to a degree similar for the most part to their low gavage dose.
p1230
aVHowever, in contrast to chloroform, the evaluation of the other trihalomethanes in drinking water at concentrations that were equivalent to their high gavage dose was prevented by their limited solubility.
p1231
aVIn conclusion, the trihalomethanes administered by gavage increased cell proliferation and decreased DNA methylation, supporting a nongenotoxic mechanism for their carcinogenic activity in mouse liver.
p1232
aVThe dose-response curves of the trihalomethanes, especially chloroform and bromodichloromethane, suggested the need to overcome detoxification mechanisms prior to exerting full activity, which could explain their weak activity, especially that of chloroform, when administered in drinking water.
p1233
aVThe slower rate of delivery by drinking water is expected to result in a lower liver concentration that should increase the opportunity for detoxification.
p1234
aVHence, the activity of the trihalomethanes appears to be dependent on their rate of delivery, i.e., rapidly by oral gavage and more slowly in drinking water.
p1235
aVChloroform, dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) are mouse liver carcinogens that are chlorine disinfection by-products found in drinking water.
p1236
aVThe effect of chloroform on DCA and TCA-induced hypomethylation and expression of the c-myc gene and on their promotion of liver and kidney tumors was determined.
p1237
aVB6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 400, 800 and 1600 mg/l chloroform in drinking water and 500 mg/kg DCA or TCA-administered daily by gavage.
p1238
aVDCA, TCA and to a lesser extent chloroform decreased the methylation and increased the mRNA expression of the c-myc gene.
p1239
aVCo-administering chloroform prevented only DCA and not TCA-induced hypomethylation and increased mRNA expression of the gene.
p1240
aVThe effect of chloroform on tumor promotion by DCA and TCA was determined in female and male B6C3F1 mice initiated on day 15 of age with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea.
p1241
aVStarting at 5 weeks of age, the mice received in their drinking water DCA (3.2 g/l) or TCA (4.0 g/l) with 0, 800 or 1600 mg/l chloroform until they were killed at 36 weeks.
p1242
aVLiver tumors promoted by DCA and TCA were predominantly basophilic except for DCA-treated female mice that were eosinophilic.
p1243
aVOnly DCA promoted foci of altered hepatocytes and they were eosinophilic in both sexes.
p1244
aVChloroform prevented DCA, but not TCA promotion of liver foci and tumors.
p1245
aVIn male mice, TCA promoted kidney tumors while DCA promoted kidney tumors only when co-administered with chloroform.
p1246
aVHence, chloroform prevented the hypomethylation and increased mRNA expression of the c-myc gene and the promotion of liver tumors by DCA, while enhancing DCA-promotion of kidney tumors.
p1247
aVThus, the concurrent exposure to two carcinogens, chloroform and DCA resulted in less than additive activity in one organ and synergism in another organ.
p1248
aVChloroform, dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) are mouse liver carcinogens (1,2) that are found in finished drinking water being formed as by-products of chlorine disinfection (3,4).
p1249
aVThis results in humans being exposed simultaneously to the three carcinogens in water.
p1250
aVAlthough chloroform was carcinogenic in the liver of mice when administered by gavage (1), when administered in drinking water it was not carcinogenic and did not promote liver tumors (5\u20137).
p1251
aVIn contrast to chloroform, DCA and TCA when administered in drinking water were carcinogenic in mouse liver (2,8\u201312) and promoted N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-initiated mouse liver tumors (13,14).
p1252
aVThe kidney is another potential target organ for the three carcinogens.
p1253
aVChloroform has been reported to induce kidney epithelial tumors in one of four strains of male mice (15) and in male Osborne-Mendel and F 344 rats (1,5).
p1254
aVAlthough, DCA and TCA have not been sufficiently evaluated in 2-year carcinogenesis bioassays to eliminate the kidney as a target organ, the limited bioassays of them have not reported kidney tumors (8\u201314).
p1255
aVHowever, both DCA and TCA are metabolites of trichloroethylene, a kidney carcinogen in mice (16) suggesting that at least one of the chloroacetic acids might be carcinogenic in this organ.
p1256
aVAs the liver and possibly the kidney are common target organs for chloroform and the chloroacetic acids, the potential exists for them to interact with respect to their carcinogenic activity.
p1257
aV5-Methylcytosine (5-MeC) is a natural modification of DNA.

aVThe formation of 5-MeC in DNA is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase), uses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and yields S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).

aVDNA hypomethylation, is an early event in most human and animal cancers (17\u201320).
p1261
aVDNA methylation regulates the expression of genes, so that hypomethylation in the promoter region of some genes, including protooncogenes has been associated with increased expression (17,21\u201323).
p1262
aVWe have demonstrated that chloroform, DCA and TCA decreased the methylation of the c-myc gene and that DCA and TCA increased the expression of the mRNA of the gene (24\u201327).
p1263
aVc-Myc is one of the immediate-early protooncogenes associated with increased cell proliferation in the liver (28,29).
p1264
aVThe c-myc protein is required for efficient progression through the cell cycle (30,31).
p1265
aVIt forms a heteromeric complex with the murine Myn protein (32) and the human homolog, Max protein (33).
p1266
aVThis activates transcription of genes including cdc25A and cyclins A, D1 and E that are associated with cell proliferation (34).
p1267
aVThe involvement of DNA methylation in the regulation of the expression of protooncogenes would suggest a potential for decreased methylation to up-regulate cell proliferation.
p1268
aVThis potential to enhance cell proliferation plus the DNA hypomethylation found in most cancers has lead to DNA hypomethylation being proposed as a mechanism of non-genotoxic carcinogens (35).
p1269
aVWe report here the effect of co-administering chloroform on the ability of DCA and TCA to hypomethylate and increase the mRNA expression of the c-myc gene and to promote liver and kidney tumors.
p1270
aVTumor promotion was determined using an initiation\u2013promotion assay consisting of initiation with MNU-administered to mice on day 15 of age followed after weaning by drinking water exposure to DCA or TCA with/without chloroform.
p1271
aVWe have used previously this assay to demonstrate the tumor promoting activity of DCA, TCA and mixtures containing them (13,14).
p1272
aVMNU was chosen as the initiator because when administered to newborn mice it initiated both liver and kidney tumors (36,37).
p1273
aVThis allowed us to evaluate the effect of chloroform on the tumor promotion by DCA and TCA in both the liver and kidney.
p1274
aVChloroform, proteinase K and ribonuclease A type III-A were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO), DCA and TCA were from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI) and HpaII was from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA).

aVFemale B6C3F1 mice at 7\u20138 weeks of age were exposed to 0, 400, 800 and 1600 mg/l chloroform in their drinking water for a total of 17 days.
p1285
aVThe high concentration of chloroform was chosen because it was the maximum concentration that did affect the body weight and drinking water consumption of the mice (26,38).
p1286
aVDaily, during the last 5 days of exposure to chloroform, the mice were also administered by oral gavage 500 mg/kg of either DCA or TCA in 4.0 ml/kg of water neutralized with sodium hydroxide.
p1287
aVWe have demonstrated previously that these dose levels of DCA and TCA decreased the methylation and increased the expression of the c-myc protooncogene (24,27).
p1288
aVVehicle-control mice received 4.0 ml/kg of saline.
p1289
aVAll the treatment groups contained six mice.
p1290
aVThe mice were killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation.
p1291
aVThey were killed at 100 min after the last dose of the chloroacetic acids or vehicle because we have shown it to result in peak expression of the mRNA for the c-myc gene (24).
p1292
aVAt necropsy, the liver was rapidly excised, weighed and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
p1293
aVThe frozen liver was stored at \u201375°C.

aVMethylation of the promoter region of the c-myc gene was evaluated using HpaII restriction enzyme digestion followed by Southern blot analysis as described previously (24\u201327).
p1295
aVHpaII does not cut CCGG sites when the internal cytosine is methylated.
p1296
aVBriefly, isolated DNA was digested overnight with HpaII (10 U/mg DNA) at 37°C.
p1297
aVThe digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel.
p1298
aVTo control for variation among gels, each gel contained the same number of samples from mice exposed to 0, 400, 800 and 1600 mg/l chloroform.
p1299
aVEqual loading of the gel was indicated by equal ethidium bromide fluorescence.
p1300
aVThe gels were washed with 2× SSC (saline-sodium citrate buffer) and transferred to Hybond\u2122-N+ nylon membranes using a Model 785 vacuum blotter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
p1301
aVThe DNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation.
p1302
aVThe membranes were then pre-hybridized at 42°C for 1 h in 20 ml pre-hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× Dehardt's Reagent, 6× SSPE (saline-sodium phosphate\u2013EDTA buffer), 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS and 100 mg/ml denatured non-homologous DNA).
p1303
aVRandom 32P-labeled c-myc probe (65 ng) was added to the pre-hybridization solution and hybridization continued for 12 h at 42°C.
p1304
aVAfter hybridization, the membranes at 20 min intervals were stringently washed five times with 4× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 65°C, three times with 2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 37°C and finally once with 2× SSC at 37°C.
p1305
aVThey were then dried, sealed in plastic bags and processed at \u201370°C with Kodak Biomax MR X-ray film, Kodak intensifying screens and a Kodak M35A automatic film processor.
p1306
aVOptical density of the autoradiograms was measured with a Scion Image Analysis System (Scion, Frederick, MD).
p1307
aVThe c-myc probe was designed from the GeneBank database (GeneBank accession number M1234) to contain the 1\u20131315 bp in the promoter region of the gene.
p1308
aVThe probe was produced by PCR amplification of mouse liver DNA using sense 5\u2032-TCTAGAACCAATGCA CAGAGCAAAAG-3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032-GCCTCAGCCCGCAGTCCAGTACTCC-3\u2032 primers.

aVcDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using 15 U AMV (avian myeloblastosis virus) reverse transcriptase in 20 \u03bcl of reaction mixture containing 0.5 \u03bcg oligo(dT)15 primer, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 U/\u03bcl recombinant RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, 1× reverse transcription buffer [10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl and 0.1%Triton X-100], and 1 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate.
p1311
aVThe reaction was at 42°C for 40 min, followed by 99°C for 5 min and 4°C for 5 min.
p1312
aVThe cDNA samples were diluted 5-fold with nuclease-free water and used for PCR amplification.
p1313
aVc-myc and the housekeeping gene, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) were co-amplified in 50 \u03bcl of reverse transcription buffer containing 10 ng/\u03bcl first strand cDNA, 100 \u03bcM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase, and 25 pmol of upstream and downstream primers for c-myc and HPRT.
p1314
aVPrimer sequences for c-myc (GenBank database accession number Z38066) were upstream: 5\u2032-TGACGAGACCTTCGTGAAGA-3\u2032 (453\u2013472 bp) and downstream: 5\u2032-ATTGATGTTATTTACACTTAAGGGT-3\u2032 (821\u2013845 bp).
p1315
aVFor HPRT (GenBank database accession number J00423) the upstream primer sequence was 5\u2032-GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3\u2032 (576\u2013594 bp) and the downstream primer sequence was 5\u2032-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3\u2032 (805\u2013824 bp).
p1316
aVThe incubation underwent 35 cycles of 94°C for 60 s, 57°C for 60 s and 72°C for 60 s, followed by 72°C for 10 min.

p1319
aVThe optical density of c-myc mRNA was standardized using the density of the HPRT gene.
p1320
aVFemale B6C3F1 mice with litters were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Frederick, MD) and arrived at the laboratory animal facility of the Medical College of Ohio with pups at 7\u20138 days of age.
p1321
aVOn day 15 of age all the pups received by i.p.
p1322
aVinjection 30 mg/kg MNU in saline (4.0 ml/kg).
p1323
aVThe pups were weaned at 4 weeks of age and randomly assigned to the different treatment groups with littermates dispersed among the groups.
p1324
aVOne week later, they started to receive in their drinking water 0, 3.2 g/l DCA (25 mmol/l) or 4.0 g/l TCA (25 mmol/l) with 0, 800 or 1600 mg/l chloroform.
p1325
aVThe drinking water was neutralized with sodium hydroxide.
p1326
aVThe mice received, therefore, equal molar concentrations of DCA and TCA that we have shown previously to be well tolerated and to promote liver tumors (13,14).
p1327
aVThe concentrations of chloroform were chosen because in experiment 1 they prevented DCA-induced hypomethylation and increased expression of the c-myc gene suggesting that they might also prevent DCA-promotion of liver tumors.
p1328
aVThe mice were killed at 36 weeks of age by carbon dioxide asphyxiation.
p1329
aVThe body, liver and kidney weights were obtained at necropsy and the two organs evaluated for tumors.
p1330
aVThe liver was cut into 3\u20134-mm blocks and along with the right kidney cut transversally and the left kidney cut longitudinally were fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.
p1331
aVParaffin sections (5 mm) were obtained from all the liver blocks and from the two blocks of each kidney.
p1332
aVThe sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic evaluation.
p1333
aVThe liver sections were evaluated for foci of altered hepatocytes, hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular adenocarcinomas.
p1334
aVThe liver foci and tumors were characterized as being either basophilic or eosinophilic.
p1335
aVFoci of altered hepatocytes in this study contained six or more cells and hepatocellular adenomas were distinguished from foci by the occurrence of compression at &gt;75% of their border.
p1336
aVHepatocellular adenocarcinomas had irregular borders and nuclear pleomorphism and atypia.
p1337
aVThe kidneys were evaluated for tumors.
p1338
aVRenal adenomas were defined as being greater than five proximal convoluted tubules in size and most often compressing adjacent tissue.
p1339
aVMorphologically they were characterized as cystic adenomas and papillary cystic adenomas.
p1340
aVAdenocarcinomas in the kidney either markedly compressed or infiltrated adjacent tissue and contained prominent nuclear pleomorphism.
p1341
aVSigmaStat software, version 2.03 (Jandel, San Rafeal, CA) was used to perform the statistical analysis.
p1342
aVThe results were analyzed for statistical significance by a one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test with a P-value &lt; 0.05.
p1343
aVDCA and TCA with/without concurrent exposure to chloroform did not significantly affect the body weight of the mice (data not presented).
p1344
aVThe liver/body weight ratio was increased by DCA and TCA from 4.81 ± 0.04 to 7.07 ± 0.12 and 6.19 ± 0.12, respectively (P-value &lt; 0.001).
p1345
aVHence, DCA increased the ratio more than TCA.
p1346
aVCo-administering chloroform with DCA or TCA did not significantly affect their ability to increase the liver/body weight ratio.
p1347
aVThe DCA, TCA and to a lesser extent 1600 mg/l chloroform decreased the methylation in the promoter region of the c-myc gene (Figure 1).
p1348
aVThis was evident after HpaII digestion of the DNA by the appearance of three bands, i.e.
p1349
aV0.5, 1.0 and 2.2 kb, that were absent in digested DNA from control mice.
p1350
aVWe have demonstrated previously that these bands resulted from HpaII digestion of the promoter region of the c-myc gene (23,24).
p1351
aVThus, when DNA from control or chloroacetic acid-treated mice was digested by both the methyl insensitive XbaI and Eco010901 enzymes only a single band was present and it was of the expected 1.4 kb.
p1352
aVDigestion with only one of the two restriction enzymes did not result in this band.
p1353
aVFurthermore, we have demonstrated that these bands resulted from hypomethylation of CCGG sites with at least one of the sites being within the promoter region of the c-myc gene and for the 2.2 kb band, the other site being upstream of this region.
p1354
aVWhen DNA from control mice and from DCA, TCA and chloroform-treated mice was digested with the methylation insensitive MspI and probed for c-myc, numerous smaller bands were found between 100 and 600 bp.
p1355
aVApparently, the smear resulted from MspI cutting the large number of CCGG sites, i.e.
p1356
aV12 sites in the area of the gene probed.
p1357
aVThus using MspI, the DNA was demonstrated to be susceptible to digestion.
p1358
aVFurthermore, while treatment with DCA, TCA and chloroform resulted in some of the sites becoming unmethylated, many were still methylated as indicated by the occurrence of distinct and larger bands after HpaII digestion.
p1359
aVThe intensity of the three bands in Hpa II-digested DNA from mice exposed to DCA or TCA with/without chloroform is presented in Figure 2A and B. Chloroform (800 and 1600 mg/l) significantly reduced the intensity of the three bands in HpaII-digested DNA from DCA-administered mice, indicating that chloroform prevented DCA-induced hypomethylation of the c-myc gene (Figure 2A).
p1360
aVIn contrast, the intensity of the three bands in HpaII-digested DNA from TCA-treated mice was not affected by chloroform (Figure 2B).
p1361
aVThus, chloroform prevented the ability of DCA, but not TCA to decrease the methylation of the c-myc gene.
p1362
aVNorthern blot analysis for the c-myc gene indicated virtually undetectable levels of its mRNA in liver from vehicle-treated control mice with increased levels in liver from mice treated with DCA, TCA and chloroform (data not presented).
p1363
aVThe probes and procedure for the northern blot analysis have been published previously by us (24,25).
p1364
aVAlthough, the high concentration of chloroform increased the expression of the mRNA for the c-myc gene, it was less effective than either DCA or TCA.
p1365
aVFurthermore, northern blot analysis indicated that chloroform reduced the ability of DCA but not of TCA to increase the expression of the mRNA for c-myc.
p1366
aVTo confirm and better quantify this effect of chloroform, the expression of the mRNA for c-myc was determined by RT\u2013PCR analysis (Figure 3).
p1367
aVSimilar to northern blot analysis DCA, TCA and to a lesser extent chloroform increased the expression of the mRNA.
p1368
aVThe expression of the mRNA for c-myc and HPRT (housekeeping gene) was quantified and the ratio of their optical density presented in Figure 4.
p1369
aVChloroform caused a dose-dependent reduction in the ability of DCA but not of TCA to increase the expression of the mRNA for c-myc that was statistically significant for 800 and 1600 mg/l chloroform.
p1370
aVDCA and TCA with/without chloroform did not significantly affect the body weight of the mice (data not presented).
p1371
aVThe body weight of the mice at the terminal sacrifice is presented in Table I. DCA increased the liver/body weight ratio by the same extent in both sexes (8.86 ± 0.41 and 9.39 ± 0.35 for male and female mice, respectively), while TCA was more efficacious in male (7.64 ± 0.45) than in female mice (5.90 ± 0.34; P-value &lt; 0.01).
p1372
aVThe ratio in control mice did not differ for the sexes and was 4.36 ± 0.16.
p1373
aVIn female mice, DCA increased the ratio more than TCA, while in male mice they were equally effective.
p1374
aVCo-administering chloroform with DCA or TCA did not significantly affect their ability to increase the liver/body weight ratio.
p1375
aVThere was no significant treatment-related effect on kidney weight by either chloroacetic acid with/without chloroform (data not presented).
p1376
aVThe effect of DCA and TCA on the incidence of MNU-initiated mice with hepatocellular adenomas, adenocarcinomas and liver tumors (adenomas + adenocarcinomas) and on the multiplicity of liver tumors is presented in Table I and Figure 5A and B.
p1377
aVThe tumor multiplicity in MNU-initiated control mice was 0.07 ± 0.04 and 0.25 ± 0.16 in female and male mice, respectively.
p1378
aVDCA increased the incidence of mice with tumors and the tumor multiplicity in both sexes.
p1379
aVHence, the 3.17 ± 0.76 and 3.92 ± 0.54 liver tumors/mouse in DCA-treated female and male mice, respectively, were significantly greater than the multiplicity in control mice (P-value &lt; 0.001).
p1380
aVIn female mice, all of the tumors promoted by DCA were adenomas, while in male mice, 22% of the tumors were adenocarcinomas, i.e.
p1381
aV0.86 adenocarcinomas/mouse.
p1382
aVThus, although the multiplicity of liver tumors promoted by DCA was similar in both sexes, adenocarcinomas were found only in male mice.
p1383
aVTCA significantly increased in male but not female mice the incidence of mice with adenocarcinomas and with adenomas + adenocarcinomas (Table I) and the multiplicity of adenomas + adenocarcinomas (Figure 5B).
p1384
aVHence, only the 3.87 ± 0.82 tumors/mouse in male mice (P-value &lt; 0.001) and not the 0.64 ± 0.22 tumors/mouse in female mice was significantly greater than the multiplicity in control mice.
p1385
aVSixty percent of the tumors from TCA-treated male mice were adenocarcinomas.
p1386
aVIn female mice, co-administering chloroform decreased the incidence and multiplicity of liver adenomas (all the tumors were adenomas) promoted by DCA (Table I and Figure 5A), i.e.
p1387
aV1600 mg/l of chloroform decreased the multiplicity of adenomas from 3.17 ± 0.76 to zero adenomas/mouse (P-value &lt; 0.01).
p1388
aVIn male mice, 1600 mg/l of chloroform reduced the multiplicity of DCA-promoted liver tumors from 3.92 ± 0.54 to 1.08 ± 0.37 (P-value &lt; 0.05, Figure 5B).
p1389
aVIn both sexes, chloroform did not affect the incidence or multiplicity of liver tumors promoted by TCA (Table I and Figure 5A and B).
p1390
aVNo tumors were found in MNU-initiated mice that received only 1600 mg/kg chloroform (Table I).
p1391
aVThe effect of chloroform on DCA and TCA-promotion of foci of altered hepatocyte is presented in Figure 6A and B.
p1392
aVNo foci were found in MNU-initiated control mice of either sex.
p1393
aVDCA promoted a greater yield of foci in female than in male mice, i.e.
p1394
aV5.6 and 1.5 foci/mouse, respectively.
p1395
aVChloroform decreased the yield of foci promoted by DCA in both sexes, i.e.
p1396
aV1600 mg/l chloroform reduced the yield of foci to zero and 0.17 ± 0.11 foci/mouse in females and males, respectively.
p1397
aVTCA did not significantly increase the yield of foci in either sex and co-administering chloroform did not alter the low yield of foci.
p1398
aVNo foci were found in MNU-initiated mice administered only 1600 mg/l chloroform.
p1399
aVIn female mice, both the foci and tumors promoted by DCA were over 95% eosinophilic, while in male only the foci were eosinophilic (89%).
p1400
aVThe tumors in DCA-promoted male mice were basophilic (91%).
p1401
aVIn male mice, co-administering chloroform increased the percentage of foci and tumors that were basophilic from 11 to 75% and from 91 to 100%, respectively.
p1402
aVIn both sexes, all the tumors and the few foci promoted by TCA were over 97% basophilic, irrespective of whether chloroform was co-administered.
p1403
aVRenal tumors of tubular origin were found in male mice.
p1404
aVThe majority (&gt;70%) were papillary cystic adenomas with the rest being cystic adenomas and to a lesser extent tubular cell carcinomas (~5%).
p1405
aVTCA increased the incidence and the multiplicity of MNU-initiated kidney tumors from (0/8) to 87.5% (14/16) and 1.68 tumors/mouse (Figure 7).
p1406
aVChloroform did not alter the promotion of kidney tumors by TCA, i.e.
p1407
aVincidence of mice with tumors was 71.4\u201387.5% and multiplicity was 1.00\u20131.68 kidney tumors/mouse for mice administered TCA with 0, 800 or 1600 mg/l chloroform.
p1408
aVDCA did not significantly increase the incidence or multiplicity of kidney tumors, i.e.
p1409
aV24% (6/25) with tumors and 0.28 ± 0.11 tumors/mouse compared with zero tumors in eight control mice.
p1410
aVHowever, co-administering 1600 mg/l of chloroform with DCA significantly increased the incidence of male mice with kidney tumors to 100% (12/12) and the multiplicity to 1.75 ± 0.39 tumors/mouse (P-value &lt; 0.01).
p1411
aVNo kidney tumors were found in MNU-initiated male mice administered only 1600 mg/l chloroform.
p1412
aVThus, although chloroform itself did not increase the yield of kidney tumors, it did increase the yield when co-administered with DCA.
p1413
aVIn female mice, a low incidence and multiplicity of kidney tumors was found in mice administered DCA or TCA with/without chloroform.
p1414
aVThe incidence of kidney tumors among all the treatment groups of female mice ranged from to 28.6% and the multiplicity ranged from to 0.29 tumors/mouse.
p1415
aVThus, in female mice neither DCA nor TCA with/without co-administered chloroform significantly increased the incidence or multiplicity of kidney tumors.
p1416
aVChloroform, DCA and TCA are mouse liver carcinogens for which a non-genotoxic mechanism involving the enhancement of cell proliferation has been proposed (12,39,40).
p1417
aVIncreased expression of c-myc has been associated with increased cell proliferation (30,31).
p1418
aVThus, chloroform, DCA and TCA have been reported to increase the expression of the mRNA of this gene (24,25,41).
p1419
aVThe mechanism of non-genotoxic carcinogens has also been proposed to involve decreased methylation of DNA and of protooncogenes including c-myc (35).
p1420
aVChloroform, DCA and TCA appear to cause hypomethylation of DNA and of the c-myc gene by preventing the methylation of hemimethylated DNA formed when DNA is replicated (24\u201327).
p1421
aVHowever, the liver has a very low level of DNA replication, so that DCA and TCA would have to increase cell proliferation and DNA replication for there to be hemimethylated sites requiring methylation.
p1422
aVThus, we have demonstrated that DCA, TCA and Wy-14,643, another peroxisome proliferator, increased cell proliferation and DNA replication before they induced hypomethylation of the c-myc gene (27,42).
p1423
aVPrevention of the methylation of hemimethylated sites could result from: (i) decreased activity of DNA MTase; (ii) decreased availability of the methyl donor, SAM; (iii) increased concentration of SAH, an inhibitor of DNA MTase; and (iv) blockage of the access of DNA MTase to the hemimethylated sites in DNA (23).
p1424
aVThe first three possibilities are unlikely as the hypomethylation induced by DCA, TCA and Wy-14,643 was not associated with an alteration in liver concentration of either SAM or SAH or with decreased DNA MTase activity (27,42).
p1425
aVFurthermore, the occurrence of only a few, three bands after HpaII digestion of DNA from mice treated with DCA and TCA would indicate that only a very few of the 12 CCGG sites in the probed region of the c-myc gene were hypomethylated.
p1426
aVThus, digestion of the DNA with MspI that also recognizes CCGG site but is not sensitive to methylation at the internal cytosine resulted in numerous smaller bands of 100\u2013600 bp.
p1427
aVThis indicates that many of the 12 CCGG sites in the promoter region of the c-myc gene remained methylated in the liver of DCA and TCA-treated mice.
p1428
aVThe specificity of which CCGG sites become hypomethylated could result from DCA and TCA either directly or through a receptor interacting with the chromatin around CCGG sites to block methylation by DNA MTase.
p1429
aVChloroform, when administered in the drinking water was less effective than either DCA or TCA in causing hypomethylation and increasing the mRNA expression of the c-myc gene.
p1430
aVWe have reported previously that chloroform was also less efficacious in decreasing the methylation of the c-myc gene when administered in drinking water than by gavage (26).
p1431
aVThis correlated with chloroform being carcinogenic in mouse liver when administered by gavage (1) but not when administered in drinking water (5).
p1432
aVChloroform administered in drinking water also did not promote carcinogen-initiated liver tumors in mice (6,7).
p1433
aVIn contrast, concentrations in drinking water of DCA and TCA that caused hypomethylation and increased expression of the c-myc gene, also induced and promoted liver tumors (8\u201314).
p1434
aVCo-administering chloroform prevented both DCA-induced hypomethylation and increased expression of the c-myc gene and DCA-promotion of liver tumors.
p1435
aVIn contrast, chloroform did not alter the ability of TCA to hypomethylate and increase the expression of the c-myc gene and to promote liver tumors.
p1436
aVHence, the effect of chloroform on DCA and TCA-induced hypomethylation and increased expression of the c-myc gene correlated with its effect on tumor promotion by the two chloroacetic acids.
p1437
aVTherefore, the effect of chloroform, DCA and TCA on the methylation and expression of the c-myc gene correlated with their effect on tumor promotion.
p1438
aVThe mechanism by which chloroform prevented DCA but not by TCA-promotion of liver tumors and hypomethylation and increased expression of the c-myc gene could be to decrease the metabolism of DCA in the liver.
p1439
aVDCA is metabolized to a much greater extent than TCA.
p1440
aVHence, only 2% of an administered dose of DCA has been reported to be eliminated unchanged in the urine in contrast to approximately half of a dose of TCA (43).
p1441
aVIn further contrast to TCA, DCA is metabolized by glutathione S-transferase-zeta (GST-zeta) (44\u201346).
p1442
aVChloroform has been shown to decrease GSH concentration in the liver (47\u201349).
p1443
aVThus, chloroform by decreasing GSH levels could prevent the metabolism of DCA by GST-zeta.
p1444
aVAs TCA is not metabolized by GST-zeta, this would explain the lack of an affect of chloroform on TCA hypomethylation and increased expression of the c-myc gene and on its promotion of liver and kidney tumors.
p1445
aVDecreased hepatic metabolism of DCA should also increase its concentration in the kidney and thus could be the mechanism for the increase in kidney tumors when chloroform was co-administered.
p1446
aVFurthermore, the lack of an affect of chloroform on TCA-promotion of kidney could be a result of a significant proportion of a dose of TCA reaching the kidney, as indicated by urinary excretion of TCA that had not been metabolized (43).
p1447
aVThe sex sensitivity and pathogenesis of the liver tumors promoted by DCA and TCA were different.
p1448
aVMale mice were equally sensitive to the promotion of liver tumors by DCA and TCA, i.e.
p1449
aV3.92 and 3.87 tumors/mouse, while female mice were more sensitive to DCA than TCA, 3.17 and 0.64 tumors/mouse, respectively.
p1450
aVThis was consistent with previous reports that DCA and TCA possessed similar carcinogenic activity in male mice (8), while DCA induced more tumors than TCA in female mice (12\u201314).
p1451
aVAlthough in female mice, DCA induced a greater yield of tumors (adenomas + adenocarcinomas), TCA induced more adenocarcinomas; this was consistent with previous reports (12\u201314).
p1452
aVIn both sexes DCA promoted a greater yield of foci of altered hepatocytes (5.6 and 1.5 foci/mouse, respectively) than TCA, which promoted a yield of &lt;0.14 foci/mouse.
p1453
aVHence, in both sexes DCA promoted the greater yield of foci, while TCA promoted the greater yield of adenocarcinomas.
p1454
aVFurthermore, male mice were more sensitive than female to the promotion of adenocarcinomas by both chloroacetic acids, while female mice were more sensitive to the promotion by DCA of foci of altered hepatocytes.
p1455
aVThe ability of TCA to promote more adenocarcinomas than DCA and the greater sensitivity of female mice to DCA-promotion of foci appeared to correlate with the histological characteristics of the adenocarcinomas and foci.
p1456
aVAll the adenocarcinomas promoted by TCA and DCA were basophilic.
p1457
aVIn contrast, &gt;95% of the foci and tumors, all of which were adenomas promoted by DCA in female mice were eosinophilic, while in male mice 89% of the foci were eosinophilic and 91% of the tumors were basophilic.
p1458
aVIn female mice, foci and adenomas induced by DCA have been reported to be eosinophilic and GST-p positive, while the tumors including adenocarcinomas induced by TCA have been basophilic and GST-p negative (12\u201314,50).
p1459
aVIn male mice, it would appear that DCA promotes two types of proliferative lesions.
p1460
aVOne lesion consists of eosinophilic foci and adenomas that have a low propensity to progress to adenocarcinomas and the other consists of basophilic lesions that rapidly progress to adenocarcinomas as indicated by the almost complete lack of basophilic foci.
p1461
aVTCA also promoted basophilic adenocarcinomas with a very low yield of basophilic foci in both sexes.
p1462
aVThus, the promotion by TCA and DCA (male mice) of basophilic adenocarcinomas in the almost complete absence of basophilic foci would indicate that the basophilic lesions progressed more rapidly to cancer than eosinophilic foci and adenomas promoted by DCA.
p1463
aVTCA but not DCA increased the yield of MNU-initiated kidney tumors in male mice, while in female mice neither chlorinated acetic acid significantly increased the yield.
p1464
aVThis demonstrated for the first time the tumor promoting activity of TCA in the male mouse kidney.
p1465
aVThe ability of TCA but not DCA to promote kidney tumors could result from a greater amount of TCA reaching the kidney as indicated by the excretion of un-metabolized TCA in the urine (43).
p1466
aVCo-administering chloroform with DCA, but not with TCA, significantly increased the yield of kidney tumors.
p1467
aVIn the kidney, DCA and TCA have been reported to cause hypomethylation of the c-myc gene (27) indicating that hypomethylation might also be involved in their renal carcinogenicity.
p1468
aVFurthermore, we have unpublished data indicating that co-administering chloroform increased the ability of DCA but not TCA to hypomethylate the c-myc gene in the kidney.
p1469
aVThus, similar to the liver, hypomethylation of the c-myc gene correlated with the renal carcinogenic activity of DCA and TCA.
p1470
aVHowever, unlike in the liver where co-administering chloroform prevented the promotion of tumors by DCA, in the kidney it increased the promotion of tumors and the hypomethylation of the c-myc gene induced by DCA.
p1471
aVThe proposed decrease by chloroform of DCA metabolism in the liver should allow more DCA to reach the kidney increasing its promotion of tumors.
p1472
aVIn contrast, the greater amount of an administered dose of TCA that reaches the kidney un-metabolized would make it less sensitive to the effects of chloroform on metabolism in the liver.
p1473
aVDCA and TCA are metabolites of the mouse kidney carcinogen, trichloroethylene (16).
p1474
aVIt has been proposed that the metabolism of trichloroethylene to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine is involved in its carcinogenic activity in the kidney (51,52).
p1475
aVHowever, the promotion of kidney tumors by TCA and possibly by DCA would suggest that they too could contribute to the carcinogenic activity of trichloroethylene in the kidney.
p1476
aVIn summary, the ability of chloroform, DCA and TCA to hypomethylate and increase the mRNA expression of the c-myc gene in the liver correlated with their ability to promote liver tumors.
p1477
aVFurthermore, the prevention by chloroform of DCA but not TCA-induced hypomethylation and increased expression of the gene correlated with its prevention of only DCA-promotion of liver tumors.
p1478
aVHence, our results are consistent with hypomethylation and increased expression of c-myc gene being involved in the promotion of liver tumors by DCA and TCA.
p1479
aVFurthermore, our results indicate that TCA as well as DCA when chloroform is co-administered can promote kidney tumors in male mice.
p1480
aVIn addition to antagonizing inflammation by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenases (COX), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) block T-cell activation.
p1481
aVThe immunosuppressant activity of NSAID correlates with their ability to block transcription factors required for the expression of inducible response genes triggered by T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement.
p1482
aVWhereas the inhibition of nuclear factor-\u03baB by aspirin and sodium salicylate can be partly accounted for by their binding to I\u03baB kinase-\u03b2, the broad range of transcriptional targets of NSAID suggests that the products of COX activity might affect one or more among the early steps in the TCR-signaling cascade.
p1483
aVHere we show that the inhibition of NF-AT activation by NSAID correlates with a selective inhibition of p38 MAP kinase induction.
p1484
aVThe suppression of TCR-dependent p38 activation by NSAID can be fully overcome by prostaglandin E2, underlining the requirement for COX activity in p38 activation.
p1485
aVFurthermore, the inhibition of COX-1 results in defective induction of theCOX-2 gene, which behaves as an early TCR responsive gene.
p1486
aVThe data identify COX-1 and COX-2 as integral and sequential components of TCR signaling to p38 and contribute to elucidate the molecular basis of immunosuppression by NSAID.
p1487
aVNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)1 block the activity of cyclooxygenases (COX), which catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (PG) and related eicosanoids.
p1488
aVTwo COX isoforms have been identified in eucaryotic cells.
p1489
aVAlthough closely related by their enzymatic activity, COX-1 and COX-2 are implicated in different facets of the interaction of cells with their internal and external environments.
p1490
aVCOX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cells and is thought to play an important role in tissue homeostasis.
p1491
aVIn contrast, COX-2 is inducibly expressed in a more limited array of cell types in response to proinflammatory and mitogenic stimuli and is considered as the crucial mediator of inflammation (1).
p1492
aVIn agreement with the dominant role of COX-2 in inflammation, COX-2-selective NSAID have anti-inflammatory activity but limited unwanted side effects such as gastric damage and hemorrhage, typical of nonselective NSAID, which are likely to be accounted for by the inhibition of COX-1 (2).
p1493
aVNSAID harbor additional immunomodulatory properties that have been correlated with their ability to block the activation of transcription factors implicated in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and are likely to result, at least in part, from their well characterized activity on COX as exemplified by the inhibition of NF-\u03baB by cyclopentenone PG through covalent modification of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (3).
p1494
aVHowever, additional COX-independent targets of NSAID are emerging, including I\u03baB kinase itself (4) and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b4 (5).
p1495
aVAlthough the principal cellular targets of NSAID are inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, NSAID suppress T-cell proliferation, expression of surface activation markers such as CD25 and CD71, and the production of cytokines such as interleukin-2, interferon-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (6-9).
p1496
aVThe immunosuppressant activity of NSAID correlates with their ability to block transcription factors required for the expression of inducible response genes triggered by the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) following encounter with antigens, including NF-\u03baB, NF-AT, and activated protein 1 (5, 6, 9, 10).
p1497
aVThe broad range of transcriptional targets of NSAID suggests that these drugs not only inhibit the distal components of individual transcription factor activation pathways but might also affect one or more steps in the early TCR-signaling cascade leading to transcription factor activation, potentially implicating COX in this process.
p1498
aVIn support for a potential role of COX in T-cell activation, COX-1 is constitutively expressed in T-cells, whereas the gene encoding COX-2 is inducibly activated as an early response gene in response to T-cell-activating stimuli (9).
p1499
aVHere we have assessed the effect of NSAID on the TCR-signaling cascade.
p1500
aVUsing as a read-out NF-AT activation, we show that NSAID affect the MAP kinase cascade and specifically the activation of p38 MAP kinase, an effect that can be reversed by PGE2 and is therefore dependent on COX activity.
p1501
aVFurthermore, the inhibition of COX-1 results in defective induction of COX-2 expression in response to TCR engagement, highlighting a sequential role of COX-1 and COX-2 in TCR signaling to p38.
p1502
aVCell lines included a stably transfected Jurkat T-cell line expressing luciferase under the control of a trimer of the distal NF-AT binding site on the human interleukin-2 gene promoter (11), the monocyte line U937, and the Raji B-leukemia cell line.

aVTo assay p38 and Erk1/Erk2 phosphorylation, 2\u20135 × 106 Jurkat cells or PBL were activated by TCR cross-linking for 1 min at 37 °C using the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 as described previously (12).

aVAll samples were in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated 3\u20135 times.
p1521
aV5 × 105 cells/sample were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin, 5.5 \u03bcg/ml transferrin, 6.5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20 \u03bcm 2\u2032,7\u2032dichlorofluorescein diacetate medium (Sigma) and preincubated 30 min in the dark at room temperature.
p1522
aVCarrier or NSAID were added, and cells were further incubated for 10 min on ice.
p1523
aVCells were subsequently spun, resuspended in the same medium, added with saturating concentrations of OKT3, and incubated for 30 min on ice.
p1524
aVAfter two washes in phosphate-buffered saline/1% serum, cells were resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of 2\u2032,7\u2032dichlorofluorescein diacetate medium, added with carrier or NSAID, incubated for further 30 min at 37 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline/1% serum, and analyzed by flow cytometry in a Becton Dickinson FACScan (San Jose, CA).
p1525
aVTotal RNA was extracted from Jurkat cells and either not activated or activated for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 h by TCR/CD3 cross-linking as described above using the RNA WIZ reagent (Ambion Inc, Austin, Texas).
p1526
aVReverse transcription-PCR was carried out using as first strand oligo(dT), whereas pairs of primers specific for human COX-2 (9) andGAPDH were used for cDNA amplification.
p1527
aVcDNAs were amplified as described previously (9) in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Thermal Cycler (Norwalk, CT).
p1528
aVPCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained bands was quantitated by laser densitometry.
p1529
aVThe identity of theCOX-2-specific reverse transcription-PCR product was confirmed by automatic sequencing.
p1530
aVConfocal microscopy was carried out on Jurkat cells transiently transfected by the DEAE/dextran procedure as described previously (12) with the plasmid pEGFP/NF-AT1-D (13), either as such or following treatment for 20 min with 500 ng/ml A23187 in the presence or absence of either 500 ng/ml cyclosporin A (Sandoz, East Hanover, NJ) or 600 \u03bcm ibuprofen, using a Leica Microsystems confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany).
p1531
aVScanning of the human COX-2gene promoter (GenBankTM accession number AF276953) for transcription factor binding sites was carried out using the matrix search program TRANSFAC MatInspector (14).
p1532
aVTo assess their impact on the TCR-signaling cascade, we assayed the capacity of NSAID to inhibit the activation of the transcription factor NF-AT using as a read-out a reporter Jurkat T-cell line stably transfected with a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of NF-AT (11).
p1533
aVThe nonselective COX inhibitors, aspirin and ibuprofen, the COX-1-selective inhibitor resveratrol (15), and the COX-2-selective inhibitor NS-398 (16) all inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the activation of NF-AT induced either by triggering the TCR/CD3 complex with agonistic mAb (Fig.
p1534
aV1) or pharmacologically using a combination of phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore (data not shown).
p1535
aVA similar profile of inhibition was also observed in a Jurkat line stably transfected with an NF-\u03baB/luciferase reporter and activated using the same pharmacological agonists (data not shown).
p1536
aVHence, both COX-1 and COX-2 activities are required for TCR signaling in T-cells.
p1537
aVAlthough COX-2-specific mRNA was detectable as early as 2 h after stimulation (Fig.
p1538
aV2 A), NS-398 only partially blocked NF-AT (Fig.
p1539
aV1) and NF-\u03baB (data not shown) activation,
p1540
aVsuggesting a dominant role for the costitutively expressed COX-1 in this process.
p1541
aVTCR triggering initiates a tyrosine kinase-based signaling cascade leading within minutes to the activation of two main pathways, the Ras/MAPK and the Ca2+/calcineurin pathways, which synergistically activate NF-AT (17).
p1542
aVWe assessed the effect of NSAID on both pathways.
p1543
aVThe inhibitors of both Erk and p38 MAPKs reduced NF-AT activation in response to TCR engagement (Fig.
p1544
aV1).
p1545
aVHowever TCR-induced p38 activity but not Erk1/Erk2 activity was dramatically inhibited both by the nonselective and by the COX-1-selective NSAID as assessed by immunoblot analysis of Jurkat T-cell lysates with phosphospecific antibodies (Fig.
p1546
aV3 A).
p1547
aVConsistent with the lack of COX-2 expression before cell stimulation (Fig.
p1548
aV2 A and Ref.
p1549
aV9), no effect on early p38 activation was observed in the presence of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398.
p1550
aVSimilar results were obtained on purified peripheral blood lymphocytes (data not shown).
p1551
aVHence, whereas Erk and p38 MAPKs are both required for TCR signaling to NF-AT, NSAID selectively inhibited p38 activation.
p1552
aVThe inhibition of p38 by both the nonselective and the COX-1-selective NSAID was also observed in Raji B-cells stimulated with anti-IgM antibodies (data not shown).
p1553
aVAlthough both mitogenic stimuli and oxidative stress can induce p38 activation (18),
p1554
aVno effect of NSAID on p38 activation was observed either in normal LPS-activated macrophages or in H2O2-treated Jurkat T-cells (Fig.
p1555
aV3 B).
p1556
aVHence, NSAID selectively affect coupling of the mitogenic pathways triggered by the T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors to p38 activation.
p1557
aVWhereas an increase in ROS, which contributes to p38 (19) activation, is induced by TCR engagement (20),
p1558
aVno effect of any of the NSAID was observed on the TCR-dependent up-regulation of intracellular ROS with the exception of resveratrol, which has anti-oxidant properties (15) (data not shown).
p1559
aVThe data are in agreement with a role for ROS upstream of COX (1) and rule out the molecules implicated in the inducible ROS production as the target of NSAID responsible for their inhibitory effect on p38 activation.
p1560
aVNSAID did not affect the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway.
p1561
aVAs shown in Fig.
p1562
aV3 D, NF-AT localization was completely cytosolic in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with a construct encoding green fluorescent protein-tagged NF-AT1 in the absence of stimulation, whereas a massive NF-AT translocation to the nucleus fully repressible by cyclosporin A was observed following treatment with a calcium ionophore.
p1563
aVIbuprofen did not affect the inducible nuclear translocation of NF-AT (Fig.
p1564
aV3 D).
p1565
aVHence, the suppression of NF-AT activation by NSAID is achieved by inhibition of the MAPK pathway and specifically of p38 activation but not of the Ca2+/calcineurin pathway.
p1566
aVOf note, although in heterologous cells, active p38 has been shown to dampen NF-AT activity by promoting its phosphorylation-dependent export from the nucleus (21).
p1567
aVIn Jurkat T-cells, both NSAID and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked NF-AT activation (Fig.
p1568
aV1) in agreement with the requirement for p38 in interleukin-2 production (22), suggesting that p38 might play opposing roles in the early activation and subsequent deactivation of gene expression.
p1569
aVThe block by NSAID of TCR-dependent p38 activation suggests that the products of COX activity are required for TCR signaling.
p1570
aVPGE2 indeed increased both the low basal level of NF-AT activity and its response to TCR triggering (Fig.
p1571
aV1).
p1572
aVFurthermore, the treatment of Jurkat cells with PGE2 resulted in the up-regulation of p38 activity, but not Erk1/Erk2, in the absence of stimulation (Fig.
p1573
aV3 C).
p1574
aVOf note, PGE2 could fully overcome the inhibition of TCR-dependent p38 activation by both ibuprofen (data not shown) and the COX-1-selective inhibitor resveratrol (Fig.
p1575
aV3 C).
p1576
aVHence, the reduction in PGE2 synthesis by COX can account for the inhibitory effect of NSAID on TCR-dependent p38 and NF-AT activation.
p1577
aVIn agreement with a role for COX upstream of p38 activation, PGE2 failed to overcome the inhibition of NF-AT activation by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (data not shown).
p1578
aVp38 can be activated by distinct pathways triggered by mitogenic stimuli and cellular stress (18).
p1579
aVThe selective effect of NSAID on the activation of p38 triggered by the TCR and B-cell antigen receptor as opposed to LPS or H2O2 (Fig.
p1580
aV3, A and B) suggests that PGE2, which is produced in response to all these stimuli, does not directly activate p38 but a component upstream of p38 in the antigen receptor-signaling cascade.
p1581
aVSpecifically, because tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways leading to Erk and p38 activation are believed to diverge at the level of the small GTPases Ras and Rac, respectively (23), our data indicate a requirement for COX in the serine-threonine kinase cascade initiated by Rac.
p1582
aVp38 activity is required both for COX-2 gene expression and for post-transcriptional stabilization of COX-2 mRNA (24, 25).
p1583
aVThe block in p38 activation by nonselective and COX-1-selective NSAID (Fig.3 A) suggests that COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in T-cells (9), is implicated in the initial activation of p38 and might therefore be required for the induction of COX-2 expression.
p1584
aVTo assess this possibility, we analyzed COX-2 expression in normal PBL.
p1585
aVTCR/CD3 stimulation as well as a combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore induced the expression of COX-2, albeit at levels significantly lower than in macrophages stimulated with LPS or pharmacological agonists (Fig.
p1586
aV2 B).
p1587
aVOf note, the monocyte line U937 constitutively expressed high levels of COX-2 (Fig.2 B),
p1588
aVwhich were parallelled by a high constitutive p38 activity (Fig.
p1589
aV3 B) in support of a key role for p38 in COX-2 expression.
p1590
aVA pretreatment of PBL with the COX-1 inhibitor resveratrol completely blocked the TCR-dependent expression of COX-2 (Fig.
p1591
aV2 C).
p1592
aVHence, COX-1 participates in the TCR-dependent induction of the gene encoding COX-2 probably by contributing to p38 activation.
p1593
aVIn agreement with the lack of effect of NSAID on LPS-dependent p38 activation in macrophages (Fig.
p1594
aV3 B), the induction of COX-2 expression by LPS is not impaired in COX-1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (26).
p1595
aVInterestingly, p38 is required for NF-AT activation (Fig.
p1596
aV1) and interleukin-2 expression (22).
p1597
aVFurthermore, cyclosporin A, which potently blocks NF-AT activation, also inhibits the induction of COX-2 gene expression, suggesting a role for NF-AT in this process.
p1598
aVIn support of this possibility, scanning of the \u223c500-bp region upstream of theCOX-2 gene containing the essential elements for its transcriptional regulation (27) revealed four potential NF-AT binding sites at positions \u2212308/\u2212297, \u2212292/\u2212281, \u2212109/\u221298 and \u221280/\u221269.
p1599
aVThe immunosuppressant activity of NSAID on T-cells underlines a role for COX activity not only in the induction of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression during inflammation but also in the normal process of lymphocyte activation.
p1600
aVCOX-2 has indeed been identified as an early response gene in peripheral T-cells (9).
p1601
aVFurthermore, genetic and pharmacological evidence supports a key role for COX-1, specifically mediated by PGE2 in the CD4\u2212CD8\u2212to the CD4+CD8+ transition during thymocyte development (28).
p1602
aVCOX-2-mediated PGE2 synthesis by thymic stromal cells is also required for the maturation of CD4+thymocytes (28).
p1603
aVOur data show that COX-1 is a strategic component of the TCR-signaling cascade in that it promotes the activation of p38 and of transcription factors regulated by this MAPK.
p1604
aVAmong the transcriptional targets of these factors is COX-2.
p1605
aVIn this scenario, the initial burst of ROS production following TCR engagement, as well as the rapid early increase in the concentration of arachidonic acid due to the sequential activity of phospholipase C\u03b3 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), would result in the up-regulation of COX-1 activity and increased synthesis of PG, thereby promoting p38 activation.
p1606
aVThis would in turn lead to COX-2 expression and a delayed phase of PG synthesis.
p1607
aVIn this context, the partial inhibition of NF-AT activation by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (Fig.
p1608
aV1 and Ref.
p1609
aV9) suggests that COX-2-dependent PG production might contribute to sustaining NF-AT activity at later stages of T-cell activation.
p1610
aVInterestingly, mast cells from cPLA2 \u2212/\u2212 mice fail to express COX-2 in response to cytokines, however arachidonic acid restores COX-2 expression (29), supporting our proposed role for COX-1-dependent PG production in the regulation ofCOX-2 transcription.
p1611
aVCollectively, our data not only provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressant activity of NSAID in T-cells but suggest that selective p38 inhibitors might be a valid alternative to classical immunosuppressants as a tool to control T-cell activation in disease.

aVThe determination of differences in hormonal regulation of tumor promotion-related response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (TCDD) between males and females may identify factors contributing to the female-specific hepatocarcinogenicity of TCDD in rats.
p1613
aVIn the current study, diethylnitrosamine-initiated male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to TCDD or corn oil vehicle in the presence and absence of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), and cell proliferation and development of preneoplastic altered hepatic foci (AHF) were determined.
p1614
aVAfter 30 weeks of exposure, \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)-positive AHF and the number of placental glutathione-s-transferase (PGST)-positive AHF were significantly higher in TCDD-treated rats than in control rats.
p1615
aVBoth the number and volume fraction of GGT-positive AHF were significantly lower in rats cotreated with E2 regardless of TCDD exposure compared with corresponding non-E2-treated groups and were unaffected by TCDD.
p1616
aVIn contrast, the number of PGST-positive AHF was significantly higher in E2-treated rats in the absence of TCDD treatment.
p1617
aVIn addition, whereas E2 had no effect on the volume fraction of PGST-positive foci, the levels in rats cotreated with both E2 and TCDD were significantly higher than in controls.
p1618
aVNo differences were observed in cell proliferation between TCDD-treated and control rats, although cell proliferation was lower in rats exposed to E2 compared with placebo controls.
p1619
aVThe weaker potency of tumor promotion and lack of induction of cell replication and DNA damage in male rats likely explain the female-specific hepatocarcinogenicity of TCDD in chronic bioassays.
p1620
aVThe ubiquitous environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a multisite rodent carcinogen in both sexes (Kociba et al., 1978; NTP, 1982).
p1621
aVTCDD is considered a nongenotoxic carcinogen because it fails to exhibit genotoxicity in in vivo and in vitro assays (Kociba, 1984; Poland and Glover, 1979; Turteltaub et al., 1990; Wassom et al., 1977).
p1622
aVIn a two-stage initiation-promotion model for hepatocarcinogenesis, TCDD is a potent promoter in rodent skin, liver, and lung (Beebe et al., 1995; Pitot et al., 1980; Poland et al., 1982).
p1623
aVIn tumor promotion studies, TCDD promotes the formation of liver tumors (Pitot et al., 1980; Walker et al., 2000) and various phenotypes of preneoplastic enzyme-altered hepatocellular foci (AHF) (Flodström and Ahlborg, 1992; Pitot et al., 1980; Waern et al., 1991) in initiated rats at a similar exposure level reported in the chronic 2-year bioassay by Kociba et al.(1978).
p1624
aVHepatic tumor development after chronic exposure to TCDD is specific to female rats (Kociba et al., 1978; NTP, 1982).
p1625
aVAlthough the early Ah receptor-mediated molecular events are well characterized (Schmidt and Bradfield, 1996; Sutter and Greenlee, 1992; Swanson and Bradfield, 1993), it is not currently known how TCDD, the most potent ligand for the Ah-receptor, causes cancer in rats.
p1626
aVThe induction of preneoplastic AHF by TCDD in chronic tumor promotion studies is well characterized.
p1627
aVChronic exposure of female Sprague-Dawley rats to more than 100 ng/kg/day of TCDD significantly induces AHF expressing the placental form of glutathione-s-transferase (PGST) (Bager et al., 1997; Flodström and Ahlborg, 1992; Maronpot et al., 1993; Tritscher et al., 1995; van der Plas et al., 1999; Walker et al., 2000) and AHF expressing \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) (Flodström and Ahlborg, 1989; Flodström et al., 1991; Graham et al., 1988; Hemming et al., 1995; Waern et al., 1991; Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1628
aVTo elucidate biological and physiological contributing factors to the mechanism of tumor promotion, studies have investigated the hormonal regulation of tumor promotion by TCDD.
p1629
aVOvarian hormones have been shown to contribute to tumor promotion by TCDD in female Sprague-Dawley rats (Lucier et al., 1991; Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1630
aVOvariectomized (OVX) rats had significantly diminished development of GGT-positive AHF induced by TCDD compared with sham-operated rats (Lucier et al., 1991).
p1631
aVAdditionally, the induction of GGT-positive AHF by TCDD in intact female rats is not observed in OVX female rats (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1632
aVOxidative DNA damage and increased cell proliferation may be critical factors that contribute to the process of tumor promotion (Ames and Gold, 1990, 1991; Butterworth et al., 1992).
p1633
aVLeft unrepaired, lesions that form as a result of oxidative DNA damage may be fixed into the genome during subsequent cell replication.
p1634
aVResulting mutations in genes involved in growth and differentiation may, therefore, result in an increase in the population of initiated hepatocytes and altered growth properties of initiated hepatocytes undergoing clonal expansion.
p1635
aVThe induction of cell proliferation and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) oxidative DNA adducts depends on ovarian hormones (Lucier et al., 1991; Tritscher et al., 1996; Wyde et al., 2001a,b).
p1636
aVTCDD-induced cell proliferation after 30 weeks of exposure is observed in intact, but not OVX, rats (Lucier et al., 1991; Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1637
aVSimilarly, 8-oxo-dG adducts are significantly induced by TCDD in intact rats but not OVX female rats (Tritscher et al., 1996; Wyde et al., 2001b).
p1638
aVAdditionally, TCDD-induced adduct formation is observed in female rats but not male rats (Wyde et al., 2001b).
p1639
aVThese data provide further evidence of ovarian hormone modulation of 8-oxo-dG adduct formation.
p1640
aVThrough increased cell proliferation in combination with increased DNA damage, TCDD may indirectly induce mutation frequency via an ovarian hormone-dependent mechanism.
p1641
aVThe endogenous estrogen 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) may contribute to the ovarian hormone-modulated mechanism of TCDD-induced tumor promotion in female rats.
p1642
aVIt has been shown that continuous treatment of OVX female rats with estradiol can compensate for the inhibitory effect of ovariectomy on TCDD-induced tumor promotion (Wyde et al., 2001b).
p1643
aVAlthough E2 itself does not induce AHF formation or cell proliferation in OVX Sprague-Dawley rats, it does enhance TCDD-induced increases in GGT-positive AHF and cell proliferation (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1644
aVNo significant induction of GGT-positive AHF is observed in OVX rats without E2 exposure.
p1645
aVIn OVX rats receiving supplemental E2, TCDD significantly induces hepatocyte proliferation (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1646
aVAdditionally, 8-oxo-dG adduct formation is induced by TCDD in OVX female rats receiving supplemental E2 (Wyde et al., 2001b).
p1647
aVThese data support the hypothesis that E2 enhances tumor promotion by TCDD.
p1648
aVThe hormonal regulation of AHF, cell proliferation, and oxidative DNA damage is consistent with the sex and ovarian hormone influence on induction of hepatic tumor incidence by TCDD.
p1649
aVTCDD induces the expression and activity of cytochrome P-450 isozymes that metabolize E2 to catechol estrogens in Sprague-Dawley rats (Drahushuk et al., 1996; Graham et al., 1988; Hakansson et al., 1994; Vanden Heuvel et al., 1994).
p1650
aVCatechol estrogens are rodent carcinogens (Liehr et al., 1986; Newbold and Liehr, 2000) that may contribute to estrogen-induced carcinogenesis through reactive oxygen intermediates (Li et al., 1995; Liehr, 1994; Liehr and Roy, 1990; Yager and Liehr, 1996).
p1651
aVTCDD-induced tumor promotion may involve catechol estrogen-derived reactive oxygen formation or leakage of oxygen radicals from the active site of TCDD-inducible cytochrome P-450, including P-4501A1 (Park et al., 1996).
p1652
aVJust as E2 or 4-hydroxyestradiol increases oxidative DNA damage in the Syrian hamster model (Han and Liehr, 1994), TCDD induces oxidative DNA damage in female Sprague-Dawley rat liver.
p1653
aVAdditionally, estrogen-modulated cell proliferation may, in combination with oxidative damage, contribute to the mechanism of tumor promotion by TCDD.
p1654
aVIn all likelihood, TCDD acts through multiple mechanisms, both estrogen modulated and estrogen independent, to induce hepatocarcinogenesis and liver tumor promotion.
p1655
aVBecause TCDD is a potent liver hepatocarcinogen in female but not male rats, most studies in the past 2 decades have further investigated the promotional effects of TCDD on liver tumor promotion in female rats.
p1656
aVThese studies have mainly characterized temporal and dose-related effects of TCDD on the formation of AHF in female rats (Dragan et al., 1992; Maronpot et al., 1993; Pitot et al., 1980; Teeguarden et al., 1999; Walker et al., 2000).
p1657
aVDespite extensive studies, little is known about the mechanism of induction of liver tumor by TCDD in the female rat.
p1658
aVAdvances have been made in the understanding of the role of ovarian hormones and E2 in TCDD-induced tumor promotion (Wyde et al., 2001b).
p1659
aVHowever, further investigations are required to determine the contribution of these factors and identify key events in the mechanism of tumor promotion and hepatocarcinogenesis by TCDD.
p1660
aVAlthough comparisons between control and TCDD-treated rats have effectively identified TCDD-induced responses, the identification of responses in female rats not occurring in male rats may indicate critical contributing factors or key events in the mechanism of tumor promotion by TCDD in Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1661
aVThe aim of the current study was to investigate tumor promotion by TCDD in male rats to elucidate key factors and critical events in the mechanism of TCDD in female rats.
p1662
aVTo determine differences in tumor promotion between male and female rats, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated male rats were treated with TCDD for 30 weeks.
p1663
aVTCDD-induced alterations in GGT- and PGST-positive AHF formation and development as markers of tumor promotion were analyzed and compared with results from similarly treated female rats (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1664
aVAdditionally, the effects of TCDD on the incorporation of 5`-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the DNA of replicating hepatocytes were determined in male rats and compared with results from similarly treated female rats (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1665
aVBecause tumor development is specific to female Sprague-Dawley rats, it was expected that exposure to TCDD in male rats would not result in a significant increase in preneoplastic AHF or an induction of hepatocyte proliferation.
p1666
aVHowever, because E2 potentiates TCDD-induced increases in GGT-positive AHF and cell proliferation in female rats, it may be expected to act similarly in male rats modulating TCDD-induced development of AHF lesions and cell proliferation.
p1667
aVTo test this hypothesis, male rats were treated with TCDD in the presence and absence of E2 administered by subcutaneously implanted pellets.
p1668
aVMale Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC) were treated as previously described (Wyde et al., 2000).
p1669
aVRats were housed 2 per cage under conditions of controlled temperature (70 ± 0.5°F), humidity (50 ± 5%), and lighting (12 h light/12 h dark) and received food and water ad libitum.
p1670
aVRats were divided into 4 groups of 8 rats each.
p1671
aVAll rats were initiated with 175 mg DEN/kg (administered intraperitoneally) at 10 weeks of age.
p1672
aVOne week after initiation, 2 groups were implanted with 90-day release pellets containing mg (placebo) and 2 groups were implanted with pellets containing 0.18 mg of E2/pellet (Innovative Research).
p1673
aVNew pellets were implanted after 90 days.
p1674
aVStarting 1 week later, 1 group of placebo-treated rats and 1 group of E2-treated rats were treated once per week with an oral gavage dose of 700 ng TCDD/kg for 30 weeks.
p1675
aVThis dose of TCDD is equivalent to a daily average dose of 100 ng TCDD/kg/day, comparable to exposure levels that induced liver tumors in female rats in the chronic bioassay described by Kociba et al.(1978).
p1676
aVThe remaining placebo and E2 groups were treated weekly by oral gavage with corn oil vehicle for 30 weeks.
p1677
aVOsmotic pumps (Alzet model 2ML1; 10 \u03bcl/h delivery rate; Alzet Corp., Palo Alto, CA) containing 30 mg/ml 5-bromo-2`-deoxyuridine in saline were implanted subcutaneously 7 days before necropsy to allow for evaluation of hepatocyte proliferation.
p1678
aVRats were killed by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide, and liver tissues were removed, weighed, sectioned, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
p1679
aVLiver slices were also fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or ethanol and embedded in paraffin.
p1680
aVSerial liver sections (5 \u03bcm thick) were cut and placed on microscope slides.
p1681
aVPGST immunohistochemistry, GGT enzyme histochemistry, and stereological analysis were performed on paraformaldehyde- and ethanol-fixed liver sections, respectively, as previously described (Wyde et al., 2001a).

aVThe incorporation of BrdU into DNA of replicating hepatocytes was determined by immunohistochemistry according to the methods of Goldsworthy et al.(1991).
p1684
aVPositively stained nuclei were scored in at least 1000 hepatocytes determined to be histopathologically nonfocal as assessed by a trained pathologist in hematoxylin and eosin counterstained tissue.
p1685
aVThe BrdU labeling index is expressed as the percentage of all nuclei counted that were positively labeled with BrdU.
p1686
aVBecause of the presence of a large number of zero values in the GGT AHF data, these data sets were analyzed by nonparametric statistical methods.
p1687
aVSignificant between-group differences were first determined by one-way Kruskal-Wallis tests (p &lt; 0.05).
p1688
aVBecause these were significant, pairwise group comparisons were subsequently made by pairwise rank-order-based Mann-Whitney U-tests (p &lt; 0.05).
p1689
aVUntransformed PGST-positive AHF and BrdU LI data exhibited homogeneity of variance when tested by Bartlett\u2019s tests.
p1690
aVLog10 transformed CYP data exhibited homogeneity of variance when tested by Bartlett\u2019s tests.
p1691
aVSignificant differences between all groups were determined by one-way ANOVA.
p1692
aVBecause the ANOVA tests indicated significant between-group effects, pairwise group comparisons were then tested using Fisher\u2019s least significant difference test (p &lt; 0.05).
p1693
aVQuantitation of CYP1A1 messenger RNA levels was determined using real-time fluorescence detection reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Walker, 2001).
p1694
aVTotal RNA was isolated from frozen liver samples using an acid-guanidinium-phenol-chloroform technique (Tri-reagent) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
p1695
aVReal-time RT-PCR reactions were prepared using a Perkin-Elmer Syber Green RT-PCR kit according the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations with the modification of the use of a CYP1A1-specific reverse-transcription primer (5`cca atc act gtg).
p1696
aVThermal cycling and real-time detection of the Syber Green-associated fluorescence was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7700 Sequence Detection system with default temperature parameters.
p1697
aVPCR primers were designed using Primer Express; forward, 5`-tcaaagagcactacaggacatttg; reverse, 5`gggttggttaccaggtacatgag.
p1698
aVQuantitation of CYP1A1 was determined by interpolation of the sample-specific cycle-threshold value against a standard curve prepared on the same plate using a 10-fold serial dilution of a quantitated liver total RNA sample.
p1699
aVThe expression level of CYP1A1 in the quantitated liver total RNA sample was determined using a competitive RT-PCR titration assay as previously described (Walker et al., 1999).
p1700
aVIn male rats treated weekly with 700 ng TCDD/kg (a daily average dose of 100 ng/kg/day) for 30 weeks, there were no significant differences in the number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 compared with control male rats (Fig.
p1701
aV1).
p1702
aVAdditionally, there were no significant differences in the number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 between TCDD-treated and control rats in the presence of E2.
p1703
aVHowever, in rats exposed to E2, the number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 was significantly lower than in male rats not receiving E2.
p1704
aVThe median number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 was 59.7 and in placebo-control and E2-treated male rats, respectively.
p1705
aVThe suppression of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 by E2 was also observed in rats exposed to TCDD.
p1706
aVIn TCDD-treated rats, exposure to E2 resulted in 3.5-fold lower median numbers of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 than in TCDD-treated rats not exposed to E2.
p1707
aVThe percentage of the liver occupied by GGT-positive AHF (volume fraction) in TCDD-treated rats was significantly higher than in control rats (Fig.
p1708
aV2).
p1709
aVA 2-fold induction in GGT-positive volume fraction by TCDD was observed with median values of 0.012% and 0.024% in control and TCDD-treated rats, respectively.
p1710
aVThe GGT-positive volume fraction was significantly lower in male rats receiving E2 than in placebo-control rats.
p1711
aVIn rats exposed to TCDD, the volume fraction of GGT-positive AHF was significantly lower in E2-treated rats than in control rats.
p1712
aVThese results are similar to the effects of E2 on the number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 (see Fig.
p1713
aV1) in both control and TCDD-treated rats.
p1714
aVPGST-positive AHF have been demonstrated to represent approximately 97% of all AHF in Sprague-Dawley rats (Teeguarden et al., 1999) and greater than 65% of all AHF in Fischer F344 rats (Hendrich et al., 1987).
p1715
aVTherefore, alterations in the development of PGST-positive AHF by TCDD and E2 were analyzed in addition to GGT-positive AHF in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1716
aVIn contrast to the observations of the suppressive effects of E2 on GGT positive AHF, the number of PGST-positive AHF/cm3 in TCDD-treated male rats was significantly higher than in control male rats (Fig.
p1717
aV3).
p1718
aVThe mean number of PGST-positive AHF was more than 2-fold higher in TCDD-treated rats than in control rats.
p1719
aVIn rats treated with E2, no significant difference was observed between TCDD-treated and control rats.
p1720
aVHowever, the number of PGST-positive AHF/cm3 was significantly higher in rats treated with E2 only compared with placebo-controls.
p1721
aVNo significant differences were observed in the volume fraction of PGST-positive AHF between TCDD-treated or E2-treated rats compared with placebo-control rats (Fig.
p1722
aV4).
p1723
aVHowever, in rats exposed to both E2 and TCDD, the volume fraction of PGST-positive AHF was significantly higher than in rats receiving E2 alone.
p1724
aVThe mean volume fraction was 0.8% in E2-treated rats and 2.2% in male rats cotreated with E2 and TCDD.
p1725
aVThe effect of TCDD and coexposure to TCDD and E2 on cell proliferation, as determined by the uptake of BrdU into the DNA of replicating hepatocytes, was determined.
p1726
aVNo significant differences were observed in BrdU labeling index between TCDD-treated and control rats; however, exposure to E2 suppressed the BrdU labeling index more than 5-fold compared with rats receiving placebo pellets (Fig.
p1727
aV5).
p1728
aVAlthough the BrdU labeling index in TCDD-treated rats was equivalent between groups receiving E2 or placebo pellets, the BrdU labeling index was significantly higher in rats cotreated with both TCDD and E2 compared with those receiving only E2.
p1729
aVThese data may reflect a suppression of cell proliferation by E2 treatment that is inhibited by TCDD in coexposed rats.
p1730
aVRelative potency of promoters based on differences in induction of the development of AHF has previously been reported (Dragan and Pitot, 1992; Pitot et al., 1987).
p1731
aVThese calculations for the promotion index allow for comparisons of potency of tumor promotion activity among sexes, species, and strains.
p1732
aVPromotion index is described by the following formula in which Vf is the volume fraction of treated rats, Vc is the volume fraction in control rats, and millimoles per week is the mean amount of promoter administered to each rat during the period of
p1733
aVTo determine whether the differences in the AHF promotion were due to differences in the level of responsiveness of male and female rats to TCDD, the expression of CYP1A1 was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Table 2).
p1734
aVIn control rats, the expression of CYP1A1 was significantly higher in males compared with females.
p1735
aVIn male and female TCDD-treated rats, CYP1A1 was significantly higher compared with their respective controls regardless of gender or hormonal status.
p1736
aVIn addition, there was no significant difference between male and females in the level of CYP1A1 expression in similarly treated TCDD-treated groups.
p1737
aVOf note, the TCDD-induced expression of CYP1A1 was significantly higher in OVX versus intact female rats.
p1738
aVThese data indicate that although the fold induction of CYP1A1 was higher in females, the level to which the male and female rats were induced by TCDD was equivalent.
p1739
aVThese data are consistent with prior observations that tissue levels of TCDD in male and female rats after similar chronic exposures are equivalent (Wyde et al., 2001b).
p1740
aVGiven the similarity in the levels of TCDD-induced expression of CYP1A1, it is unlikely that the observed differences in AHF between TCDD-treated groups are due to differences in the level of activation of the Ah receptor.
p1741
aVBecause TCDD is not a hepatocarcinogen in male rats, hepatic tumor promotion studies of TCDD have focused on female rats.
p1742
aVThese studies demonstrate dose- and duration-dependent induction of multiple phenotypes of preneoplastic AHF by TCDD in female Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1743
aVHowever, little has been determined regarding the mechanism by which TCDD induces these lesions and, subsequently, liver tumors.
p1744
aVIn the current study, the development of preneoplastic AHF lesions and alterations in cell proliferation were determined as markers and contributors to tumor promotion by TCDD in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1745
aVTCDD significantly induced the volume fraction of GGT-positive AHF.
p1746
aVThe volume fraction of AHF is the most applicable in determining the extent and efficacy of tumor promotion (Pitot et al., 1989).
p1747
aVHowever, although the median volume fraction of GGT-positive AHF was induced 2-fold over controls in male rats,
p1748
aVin a prior study in female Sprague-Dawley rats (Wyde et al., 2001a), TCDD induced a 14-fold increase in GGT-positive volume fraction.
p1749
aVAdditional studies in females have consistently demonstrated a 6- to 12-fold induction of GGT-positive AHF volume fraction after 27 to 30 weeks of exposure to TCDD depending on the initiation-promotion protocol (Flodström and Ahlborg, 1989; Graham et al., 1988; Lucier et al., 1991).
p1750
aVUsing the GGT-positive AHF data, the promotion index, a measure of potency of tumor promotion, was an order of magnitude higher in female rats than male rats.
p1751
aVTaken together, these data indicate that, based on induction of GGT-positive AHF, TCDD is a more potent promoter in female than in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1752
aVTCDD exposure did not significantly induce the number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1753
aVThis quantitative measure of AHF tends to reflect the potency and efficacy of initiation (Pitot et al., 1989).
p1754
aVIn similarly treated female rats, TCDD resulted in an elevated number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 (p = 0.085) (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1755
aVAlthough not statistically significant, an elevated number of GGT-positive AHF/cm3 is consistent with previous observations of significant increases in GGT-positive AHF/cm3 by TCDD (Flodström and Ahlborg, 1989, 1992; Waern et al., 1991).
p1756
aVBecause comparable doses of DEN were used as the initiating agent in both studies, differences in the number of AHF/cm3 may reflect differences in contribution of TCDD to continued initiation of hepatocytes throughout the duration of exposure.
p1757
aVThese data are consistent with TCDD-induced oxidative DNA damage in female, but not male, Sprague Dawley rats (Wyde et al., 2000).
p1758
aVAdditionally, in the current study, TCDD did not alter hepatocyte replication in male rats.
p1759
aVIn female Sprague-Dawley rats, TCDD-induced cell proliferation (Wyde et al., 2001a), combined with oxidative DNA damage, may contribute to increased mutation frequency.
p1760
aVSubsequent mutations in altered or initiated hepatocytes may contribute to the progression of preneoplastic lesions to hepatocellular carcinomas in female rats.
p1761
aVThis hypothesis is consistent with the sex-specific induction of liver tumors.
p1762
aVThese data suggest that the induction of cell proliferation and oxidative DNA damage may be critical events in the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis by TCDD.
p1763
aVThe development of AHF has been demonstrated to reflect clonal expansion of a single initiated hepatocyte (Rabes et al., 1982; Scherer and Hoffmann, 1971; Tsuji et al., 1988; Weinberg et al., 1987).
p1764
aVTherefore, the induction of the number of PGST-positive AHF/cm3 by TCDD suggests additional conversion of normal hepatocytes to PGST-positive hepatocytes.
p1765
aVThese results are consistent with the induction of the number of PGST-positive AHF/cm3 by TCDD in female rats (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1766
aVAdditionally, E2 exposure alone induced the number of PGST-positive AHF/cm3 but not the volume fraction in male rats.
p1767
aVThese data suggest that more, but smaller, individual AHF may contribute to the same percentage of PGST-positive liver tissue.
p1768
aVHowever, because neither TCDD nor E2 induce oxidative 8-oxo-dG DNA adducts in male Sprague-Dawley rats (Wyde et al., 2001a), subsequent mutations to normal hepatocytes must be derived via an alternative mechanism.
p1769
aVNo effect on PGST-positive volume fraction was observed after exposure to TCDD.
p1770
aVThese data indicate that the growth of PGST-positive AHF was not induced by TCDD.
p1771
aVIn contrast, TCDD induced the volume fraction of PGST-positive AHF in rats coexposed to TCDD and E2.
p1772
aVBecause the numbers of PGST-positive AHF/cm3 were similar between E2-treated and cotreated rats, these data suggest that E2 potentiates TCDD-induced growth of PGST-positive AHF.
p1773
aVAlthough these data are consistent with TCDD induction of PGST-positive AHF in female rats regardless of hormonal status, they suggest a contribution of E2 to TCDD-induced promotion of the PGST-positive phenotype of AHF in male rats.
p1774
aVAlthough the effects of TCDD and E2 on the development of PGST-positive AHF are not entirely consistent between male and female rats, previous studies suggest that PGST-positive AHF may not the most appropriate marker for assessing the effects of TCDD exposure on promotion.
p1775
aVThe GGT-positive AHF are more responsive to hormonal regulation of tumor promotion by TCDD and more appropriately reflect TCDD-induced molecular and pathological alterations in female rats (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1776
aVThe influence of ovarian hormones and E2 on TCDD-induced GGT-positive AHF is more consistent with TCDD-induced effects on cell proliferation (Lucier et al., 1991; Wyde et al., 2001a), oxidative DNA damage (Tritscher et al., 1996; Wyde et al., 2001b), and sex-specific tumor induction (Kociba et al., 1978; NTP, 1982) than alterations in PGST-positive AHF.
p1777
aVAdditionally, the relative potency of tumor promotion by TCDD in intact and OVX rats as determined by PGST-positive AHF are equivalent.
p1778
aVThe promotional index for TCDD based on PGST-positive AHF is 4.56 × 106 in intact rats and 3.25 × 106 in OVX rats.
p1779
aVThese data suggest that alterations of GGT-positive AHF may be more biologically relevant in assessing tumor promotional effects of TCDD (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1780
aVTherefore, inhibition of AHF development observed in the GGT-positive phenotype may be more accurate in evaluating the effect of E2 on tumor promotion by TCDD in male rats than the enhancement observed in the PGST-positive phenotype.
p1781
aVExposure to E2 significantly reduced hepatocyte replication and the development of GGT-positive AHF in male rats regardless of exposure to TCDD.
p1782
aVThese results are consistent with the hormonal responsiveness of GGT-positive AHF in female Sprague-Dawley rats (Wyde et al., 2001a).
p1783
aVAn increase in the development of GGT-positive AHF is reflected in the removal of ovarian hormones by ovariectomy.
p1784
aVSupplementation with E2 in OVX rats reduces GGT-positive AHF development regardless of TCDD exposure.
p1785
aVAlthough the absolute values for GGT-positive development are lower in E2-supplemented OVX rats than in intact or nonsupplemented rats, exposure to E2 in OVX female rats may contribute to the effect of TCDD on hepatic tumor promotion.
p1786
aVLower absolute values for GGT-positive AHF parameters may reflect an inhibitory effect of supraphysiological levels of E2 (Wyde et al., 2000) on GGT-positive AHF.
p1787
aVLower values were also observed in the current study in E2-treated male rats.
p1788
aVHowever, in male rats, GGT-positive AHF were not induced by TCDD in the presence of E2 exposure.
p1789
aVThis is reflected in differences in the promotion index of 2.7 × 106 in rats receiving placebo pellets and 7.7 × 104 in rats treated with E2 pellets.
p1790
aVThese data suggest that potentiation of TCDD-induced tumor promotion by E2 is specific to female rats.
p1791
aVThis study indicates that TCDD is capable of promoting the development of preneoplastic foci in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1792
aVHowever, continuous exposure to TCDD in male rats does not induce liver tumor incidence.
p1793
aVDifferences in response to TCDD in hepatocyte proliferation, oxidative DNA damage, and preneoplastic AHF development may account for sex differences in tumor response between male and female rats.
p1794
aVTCDD-induced cell proliferation and oxidative DNA damage in female Sprague-Dawley rats (Wyde et al., 2001a,b) were not observed in male Sprague-Dawley rats after 30 weeks of exposure.
p1795
aVIncreased rates of mutation may result in highly proliferative hepatocytes that exhibit higher levels of DNA damage (Ames et al., 1993).
p1796
aVHowever, increased oxidative DNA damage and increased rates of cell proliferation are not observed in female Sprague-Dawley rats after 20 weeks of exposure (Wyde et al., 2001a,b).
p1797
aVThese data suggest that the induction of cell proliferation and oxidative DNA damage may contribute to the progression of TCDD-induced preneoplastic lesions to tumors in female rats but not male rats.
p1798
aVAdditionally, differences in the potency of promotion by TCDD in males and females may contribute to the sex specificity of tumor development.
p1799
aVAlthough the number of preneoplastic AHF is suggested to plateau after extended periods of promotion, the growth of preneoplastic lesions is believed to continue until the development of hepatocellular carcinomas (Hendrich et al., 1986; Pitot et al., 1989).
p1800
aVInduction of AHF volume fraction in female rats is substantially greater than in male rats.
p1801
aVThese data provide a mechanistic foundation for differences in hepatocarcinogenesis of TCDD between male and female Sprague-Dawley rats.
p1802
aVIndole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a naturally occurring substance that shows anti-carcinogenic properties in animal models.
p1803
aVBesides its clear anti-carcinogenic effects, some studies indicate that I3C may sometimes act as a tumor promoter.
p1804
aVIndolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ), which is formed in the acidic environment of the stomach after intake of I3C, has a similar structure to, and shares biological effects with, the well-known tumor promoter 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).
p1805
aVTherefore, we hypothesized that ICZ could be responsible for the potential tumor-promoting activity of I3C.
p1806
aVThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ICZ on gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in primary cultured rat hepatocytes co-cultured with the rat liver epithelial cell line WB-F344.
p1807
aVIndolo[3,2-b]carbazole inhibited GJIC in the rat hepatocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
p1808
aVSignificant inhibition was observed after 8 and 12 h of treatment with 1 and 0.1 \u03bcM ICZ, respectively.
p1809
aVMaximum GJIC inhibition (cell\u2013cell communication only 5% of control values) was observed after 24\u201348 h of ICZ treatment.
p1810
aVContinued exposure to 1 \u03bcM ICZ suppressed GJIC until ~120 h. Both ICZ and TCDD treatment reduced the Cx32 mRNA level as well as the plasma membrane Cx32 staining.
p1811
aVIndolo[3,2-b]carbazole increased the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2 and Cyp1b1 mRNA levels concurrently with an increase in 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activities.
p1812
aVMaximum EROD activity and Cyp1a1 mRNA levels were observed after ~12 h, whereas Cyp1a2 and Cyp1b1 mRNA levels peaked after 48 h.
p1813
aVThis study shows that ICZ may possess tumor promoter activity down-regulating GJIC by mechanisms, which seem to include activation of the Ah receptor and/or Cyp1 activity.
p1814
aVSeveral studies have shown that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables (especially cruciferous vegetables) reduces the risk of various forms of cancer (1).
p1815
aVIndole-3-carbinol (I3C), which is formed in relatively high concentration during preparation and ingestion of cruciferous vegetables, reduces the level of DNA damage (2) and the incidence of chemically induced liver tumors (3) in rainbow trout fed the compound before initiation.
p1816
aVIn rats treated with aflatoxin B1, I3C was shown to inhibit both the initiation and the promotion step of the carcinogenic process (4).
p1817
aVI3C has also been shown to act as a tumor promoter.
p1818
aVIn rats, I3C was recently shown to increase the hepatic foci formation (5).
p1819
aVWhen I3C was fed to rainbow trout (3) or rats (6) after treatment with the tumor initiator 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, the incidence of liver tumors was increased.
p1820
aVFurthermore, I3C both induces and reduces ornithine decarboxylase activity (7,8), suggesting that I3C may have epigenetic effects.
p1821
aVAn overview of the reported anti-carcinogenic and carcinogenic properties of indoles is given elsewhere (9,10).
p1822
aVThe various biological effects observed for I3C in vivo are most probably caused by the condensation products of I3C formed in the acidic environment of the stomach.
p1823
aVOne of these acid-catalyzed condensation products is indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ), which has several biological and structural characteristics in common with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).
p1824
aVIndolo[3,2-b]carbazole has marginally lower binding affinity for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) than TCDD (11).
p1825
aVBoth substances induce cytochrome P-450 subfamily 1 (Cyp1) enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo (12) via activation of the AhR.
p1826
aVTherefore, we hypothesized that the observed liver tumor-promoting activity of I3C could be caused by ICZ produced during digestion.
p1827
aVGap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is generally lowered during the carcinogenic process, as documented by numerous investigations showing that connexin expression and GJIC is limited in tumors, and that tumor promoters inhibit GJIC.
p1828
aVIn vitro assays for GJIC show ~60% sensitivity for detecting known in vivo tumor promoters/epigenetic carcinogens (13), and many cell-growth inhibitors, cancer chemopreventive agents, anti-oncogenes and differentiation agents enhance GJIC (14).
p1829
aVThe inhibitory effect of TCDD on GJIC is dependent on the cell type.
p1830
aVIn WB-F344 cells or C3H/10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts, TCDD does not inhibit GJIC (15,16), whereas TCDD reduces GJIC in primary rat hepatocytes and mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa1c1c7) (17,18).
p1831
aVIt has therefore been proposed that the AhR activation is needed for TCDD to induce down-regulation of GJIC and that TCCD specifically causes a transcriptional down-regulation or reduced stability of the mRNA encoding for the gap junction protein connexin 32 (Cx32) (17).
p1832
aVCx32 is the major gap junction protein in primary hepatocytes.
p1833
aVIn contrast to hepatocytes, connexin 43 (Cx43) is the major gap junction protein in WB-F344 cells.
p1834
aVAll experiments in the present study have been performed with co-cultures of primary rat hepatocytes and rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells, as the literature indicate that the GJIC activity is more stable in the co-culture compared with the primary hepatocytes alone.
p1835
aVThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ICZ on GJIC in rat primary cultured hepatocytes and to investigate the possible role of AhR activation and/or Cyp1 enzyme activity levels in modulating the cell\u2013cell communication.

p1895
aVOne micromolar ICZ inhibited GJIC after 8 h of treatment, although not after 4 h of treatment.
p1896
aVFour hours of treatment with 10 \u03bcM ICZ caused a significant GJIC inhibition, whereas a significant inhibition of GJIC with 0.1 \u03bcM ICZ could be observed after 12 h of treatment.
p1897
aVMaximal inhibition of GJIC was induced after 24 h of treatment with 0.1 and 1 mM ICZ, corresponding to ~16 and 5%, respectively, of the GJIC in control cells.
p1898
aVContinuous treatment with 1 \u03bcM ICZ sustained the GJIC at low levels (3\u20137% of the GJIC in control hepatocytes) until 120 h of treatment, after which the level of GJIC increased.
p1899
aVGJIC was not completely restored after 192 h of treatment (Figure 2A).
p1900
aVContinuous treatment with 0.1 \u03bcM ICZ only sustained GJIC inhibition for 24 h (data not shown).
p1901
aVTCDD (1 nM) inhibited GJIC after 4 h of treatment (Figure 1) and low levels of GJIC (\u226410% of GJIC in controls) were observed until 120 h (Figure 2A).
p1902
aVAfter 192 h of treatment a slight increase in the GJIC level was also observed in the TCDD-treated hepatocytes.
p1903
aVHowever, the effect of TCDD on GJIC was sustained longer than the effect of ICZ.
p1904
aVTo identify the communication recovery rate after exposure to ICZ or TCDD, the co-cultures were exposed to 1 \u03bcM ICZ or 1 nM TCDD for 24 h and then replaced by media without the test compounds.
p1905
aVIn hepatocyte co-cultures pre-treated with ICZ, GJIC increased 12 h after replacement with fresh medium (Figure 2B).
p1906
aVAlready after 48 h of recovery, the level of GJIC was not significantly different from the level observed in DMSO controls.
p1907
aVWhen TCDD was removed from the hepatocyte culture medium, &gt;48 h was required before an increase in GJIC was observed.
p1908
aVIn the TCDD-treated hepatocytes, GJIC remained lower than in DMSO controls for the duration of the experiment (P \u2264 0.001, Figure 2B).
p1909
aVTo elucidate the mechanism of GJIC down-regulation, Cx32 and Cx43 mRNAs were quantified.
p1910
aVCx32 was only expressed in hepatocytes whereas Cx43 was only expressed in WB-F344 cells and was not affected by ICZ or TCDD treatment (data not shown).
p1911
aVA decrease in Cx32 mRNA levels was observed during the first 24 h of treatment, in both controls, ICZ- and TCDD-treated hepatocytes (Figure 3A).
p1912
aVBeyond 24 h, both ICZ and TCDD caused a reduction in the Cx32 mRNA level compared with the control.
p1913
aVIn the recovery study, the Cx32 mRNA level in ICZ-treated hepatocyte co-cultures slowly increased to the level of control hepatocytes whereas in TCDD-treated cells, the transcript levels did not return to the level of the controls within the duration of the experiment (Figure 3B).
p1914
aVBoth ICZ (1 \u03bcM) and TCDD (1 nM) decreased the Cx32 staining at the cell\u2013cell interface (Figure 4).
p1915
aVDuring the continuous treatment with ICZ, Cx32 reappears at the cell\u2013cell interface at 192 h (Figure 4).
p1916
aVCx32 immunostaining was absent in hepatocyte co-cultures treated with TCDD from 24 h onwards (Figure 4).
p1917
aVPrimary rat hepatocyte co-cultures treated with ICZ for 24 h and then allowed to recover in ICZ-free medium, showed a reappearance of Cx32 staining after 48h.
p1918
aVAfter 120 and 192 h of recovery, Cx32 staining was at about the same level as observed in DMSO controls (Figure 5).
p1919
aVIn hepatocyte co-cultures allowed to recover after 24 h of TCDD treatment, staining was absent even after 120 h in TCDD-free medium.
p1920
aVAfter 192 h of recovery, occasional immunopositive staining dots could be observed at the cell\u2013cell interface (Figure 5).
p1921
aVHepatocytes in control cultures showed Cx32 immunostaining at the cell\u2013cell interface at all time-points.
p1922
aVTo correlate the ICZ or TCDD-induced EROD activity to the observed GJIC inhibition, the EROD activity was measured both in the continuous exposure experiment and in the recovery experiment.
p1923
aVThe EROD activity was determined after 4 and 8 h of treatment with 1 and 10 \u03bcM ICZ and 1 nM TCDD, and after 8, 12, 24, 48, 120 and 192 h treatment with 0.1 and 1 \u03bcM ICZ and 1 nM TCDD.
p1924
aVBoth ICZ and TCDD induced EROD activity in rat hepatocyte co-cultures in a dose- (Figure 6) and time-dependent manner (Figure 7A).
p1925
aVInduction was observed after 4 h of treatment with both 1 and 10 \u03bcM ICZ and 1 nM TCDD (Figure 6).
p1926
aVMaximum EROD activity was observed in ICZ-treated cultures after 12\u201324 h of treatment.
p1927
aVContinued treatment decreased EROD activity approaching the level found in controls after 120 h. The same pattern was observed for Cyp1 mRNAs peaking after 12\u201348 h of treatment and thereafter decreasing to about the half their maximum levels (Figure 7B).
p1928
aVWhen ICZ was removed from the co-cultures after 24 h of pre-treatment, the EROD activity decreased much faster (Figure 8A), than observed in co-cultures treated continuously with the compound (Figure 7A).
p1929
aVAfter 120 h of recovery, EROD activity in the ICZ pre-treated cultures had decreased to the same level as in DMSO controls.
p1930
aVCo-cultures pre-treated with TCDD did not fully recover within the 192 h time series.
p1931
aVThe ICZ-induced Cyp1A mRNA expression was reduced in the same way as the ICZ-induced EROD activity (Figure 8B).
p1932
aVThe EROD activity and Cyp1 mRNA expression was identical for ICZ- and TCDD-treated cultures excluding the recovery studies, where EROD in cultures pre-treated with TCDD for 24 h did not fully reach the background activity even after 192 h recovery (Figure 8A).
p1933
aVIn WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cell cultured alone, the Cyp1b1 mRNA level was induced by ICZ, whereas the EROD activity and Cyp1a mRNA levels were not induced by ICZ or TCDD treatments (data not shown).
p1934
aVI3C has in various experiments been shown to inhibit tumor development (22\u201324).
p1935
aVSeveral possible mechanisms such as reduction of the levels of the activated genotoxic carcinogens by modulation of the metabolism (25\u201327) and reduction in DNA-adduct levels (24) have been suggested.
p1936
aVBeside these effects on the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds, I3C has also been shown to (i) reduce tumor promoter induced ornithine decarboxylase activity (28), (ii) inhibit cellular growth (29) and (iii) induce apoptosis (30).
p1937
aVI3C's anticarcinogenic properties may in part explain the reduced tumor incidence observed with large intakes of cruciferous vegetables, which support the general recommendation to increase the intake of fruit and vegetables in the human population.
p1938
aVFurthermore, I3C is also available as a food supplement for humans in pure form and it is claimed by the commercial supplier that doses exceeding those normally found in cruciferous vegetables are needed to promote human health and to prevent cancer.
p1939
aVHowever, the few reports showing a tumor-promoting effect of I3C must not be overlooked.
p1940
aVA tumor-promoting effect of this compound has been observed in both rainbow trout (3) and rats (6) after treatment with aflatoxin B1 and 1,2-dimethylhydrazin, respectively.
p1941
aVSeveral biomarkers related to tumor promotion are modulated by I3C, e.g.
p1942
aVinduction of ornithine decarboxylase activity (7).
p1943
aVVarious nitrosated and chlorinated indoles inhibit GJIC in Chinese hamster V79 cells (31,32), whereas indole-3-acetonitril, one of several degradation products of glucobrassicin, does not inhibit GJIC (31).
p1944
aVIn the present study, we clearly show that ICZ down to 0.1 \u03bcM inhibits GJIC in rat hepatocytes.
p1945
aVThis indicates that ICZ may possess a tumor-promoting activity, and that the observed inhibitory effect of ICZ may explain some of the detrimental effects observed for I3C in vivo.
p1946
aVBased on the structural and functional similarity between ICZ and the well-known tumor promoter TCDD (33), the tumor-promotive effect of ICZ is very likely.
p1947
aVTCDD inhibits GJIC in primary cultured rat hepatocytes (17), mouse hepatoma cells (18), rat liver epithelial IAR 20 cells (34,35) and rat hippocampal primary cell culture (36).
p1948
aVAn almost complete blockage of GJIC was observed after 24 h of treatment with either 1 \u03bcM ICZ or 1 nM TCDD,
p1949
aValthough it was a slower inhibition than observed for another CYP inducer, phenobarbital (2 h), in mouse hepatocytes (20).
p1950
aVThe more slowly occurring effects of TCDD and ICZ indicate that some other cellular events such as transcription of certain genes must take place before the ICZ-induced down-regulation of GJIC occurs.
p1951
aVFurthermore, during prolonged exposure to ICZ and partly TCDD, the hepatocytes show decreased sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of these compounds indicating of a possible feedback mechanism.
p1952
aVDevelopment of refractoriness has been observed for phenobarbital as well, whereas continued exposure to lindane and DDT causes a sustained inhibition of GJIC (37).
p1953
aVAlso, the recovery of GJIC after removal of the test substance was slower for ICZ and TCDD than for phenobarbital, DDT and lindane (20,37,38).
p1954
aVIn the present study, the TCDD-induced GJIC down-regulation was sustained longer than the ICZ-induced GJIC down-regulation, which may be caused by a faster removal of ICZ than TCDD.
p1955
aVIt has been suggested that TCDD only inhibits GJIC in cells expressing functional AhR (17,18).
p1956
aVBeside a direct regulation by the activated AhR, it has also been shown that down-stream cellular effects of AhR activation are involved in inhibition of GJIC [e.g.
p1957
aVCyp inhibitors, antioxidants (39,40), cAMP (17) and protein kinase inhibitors (39)].
p1958
aVCyp1a1, Cyp1a2 and Cyp1b1 genes are parts of the AhR gene battery.
p1959
aVTherefore, the immediate increase in EROD activity, and in Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2 and Cyp1b1 mRNA levels, and down-regulation after removal of ICZ, which correlated well with the inhibition of GJIC, indicates that AhR activation and/or Cyp activities are involved in the observed inhibition of GJIC.
p1960
aVPreliminary studies performed in our laboratory using the Cyp1a inhibitors (SKF-525A and \u03b1-naphthoflavone) indicate a direct role of the Cyp1a activity on the down-regulation of GJIC.
p1961
aVIn contrast to the good correlation between the immediate rise in EROD activity and inhibition of GJIC, no clear correlation was found during the later stages of declining EROD activity and increasing GJIC.
p1962
aVIn the present experiments, the WB-F344 cells alone had no induction of Cyp1a1 mRNA or EROD, indicating that these cells do not show Ah-receptor activity, as found by one other group (41).
p1963
aVThe level of GJIC measured agrees well with the Cx32 immunoreactive staining at the cell\u2013cell interface.
p1964
aVExposures to ICZ or TCDD lowered the Cx32 staining and GJIC, and the re-establishment of GJIC correlated well with the reappearance of Cx32 immunostaining at the cell\u2013cell interface.
p1965
aVSmall dots of staining were observed in the area over the nucleus in hepatocytes with reduced or no Cx32 staining at the cell\u2013cell interface.
p1966
aVThe Cx32 mRNA level was reduced when treated with ICZ and TCDD during the total treatment period when compared with controls.
p1967
aVThis indicates that the initial inhibition of GJIC is at least partly caused by a down-regulation of the transcription of Cx32, but it is not possible to exclude any inhibitory effects directly on the functional Cx32.
p1968
aVThe continuously low level of Cx32 mRNA throughout the experiment, also when GJIC and the Cx32 plaques are partly recovered, point out a second mechanism of regulation at post-transcriptional level.
p1969
aVThe present results show that ICZ may possess tumor-promoter activity, although various factors may modify this effect in vivo.
p1970
aVThe GJIC inhibitory effects of ICZ at concentration below 0.1 \u03bcM are not known and only small amounts of ICZ are formed in the human body during ingestion of cruciferous vegetables.
p1971
aVOnly 0.0002% ICZ is formed during a 10 min acid-catalyzed conversion of I3C (11) but in rats the level of ICZ increased dramatically in the liver following a single intake of 500 \u03bcmol I3C/kg body wt to 0.06 nM (42) and to 1.6 nM following a 7 days treatment with 880 mmol I3C/kg body wt/day (43).
p1972
aVFurthermore, other I3C-derived products may also act as ligands for the AhR and hence add to the possible cancer-promoting activity of ICZ.
p1973
aVIn conclusion, the results presented in this report demonstrate that ICZ inhibits GJIC in rat primary hepatocytes by preventing the synthesis and/or the fusion of Cx32 proteins with the cell membrane.
p1974
aVFurthermore, ICZ induces the EROD activity concomitant with a reduction in Cx32 immunostaining at the hepatocyte\u2013hepatocyte interface.
p1975
aVThe effects, however, are transient and the level of GJIC and Cx32 staining returns to normal levels after about a week of continuous treatment.
p1976
aVThe studies reported herein do indicate that ICZ reduces hepatocyte GJIC possibly through AhR activation and/or increased Cyp1 activity.
p1977
aVThe inhibition of GJIC by ICZ may indicate that ICZ has tumor-promoting activity.
p1978
aVThese results call for studies focusing on the tumor-promoting activity of ICZ and perhaps other degradation products of I3C, before I3C supplement recommendations should be made to healthy individuals.
p1979
aVOur recent research indicated that phenobarbital (PB) may inhibit the development of N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated pre-neoplastic lesions at low doses in a rat liver medium-term bioassay (Ito test), while high doses exhibit promoting activity.
p1980
aVThis raises the question of whether treatment with low doses of PB might reduce cancer risk.

aVFor clarification, male 6-week-old F344 rats were treated with PB at doses of 0, 2, 15 and 500 p.p.m.

p1983
aVIn a second, short-term experiment, animals were given PB at doses of 2, 4, 15, 60 and 500 p.p.m.
p1984
aVfor 8 days.
p1985
aVFormation of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci and liver tumors was inhibited at 2 p.p.m.
p1986
aVGeneration of oxidative DNA damage marker, 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), cellular proliferation within the areas of GST-P positive foci and apoptosis in background liver parenchyma were suppressed.
p1987
aVSuppression of 8-OHdG formation by PB at low dose might be related to the enhanced mRNA expression of 8-OHdG repair enzyme, oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (Ogg1).
p1988
aVMoreover, as detected by cDNA microarray analysis, PB treatment at low dose enhanced mRNA expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and suppressed MAP kinase p38 and other intracellular kinases gene expression.
p1989
aVOn the contrary, when PB was applied at a high dose, GST-P positive foci numbers and areas, tumor multiplicity, hydroxyl radicals and 8-OHdG levels were greatly elevated with the increase in CYP2B1/2 and CYP3A2 mRNA, protein, activity and gene expression of GST, nuclear tyrosine phosphatase, NADPH- cytochrome P-450 reductase and guanine nucleotide binding protein G(O) alpha subunit.
p1990
aVThese results indicate that PB exhibits hormetic effect on rat hepatocarcinogenesis initiated with DEN by differentially altering cell proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage at high and low doses.
p1991
aVIt is generally believed that rodent carcinogens are human carcinogens, despite the existence of exceptions, the prevailing paradigm is that even tiny doses can induce cancer (1).
p1992
aVHowever, many studies have shown benefits, not harm, from low-level exposure to toxicants, this phenomenon being known as hormesis (2).
p1993
aVFurthermore, it has been observed that for some substances tested, carcinogens are similar to other toxicants in improving health at low doses, although, the mechanism of their action remains unclear (3).
p1994
aVPhenobarbital (PB), a sedative and anti-convulsant used as an anti-epilepsy drug in humans, is also a non-genotoxic carcinogen and a well-known promoter of hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo and in vitro (4\u20139).
p1995
aVThe promoting effect of PB at a high dose on hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents has been extensively studied, but reasons for its carcinogenic action have yet to be unequivocally clarified.
p1996
aVIncreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the activity of detoxifying enzymes and induction of oxidative stress are suggested to be possible mechanisms by which non-genotoxic chemicals may exert carcinogenicity (10,11).
p1997
aVOxygen radicals attack DNA bases and deoxyribose residues, producing damaged bases and single strand breaks, or oxidize lipid and protein molecules, generating intermediates which can react with DNA and form adducts.
p1998
aVAmong the more abundant types of base modifications, 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), produced by the oxidation of deoxyguanosine, is considered as the most sensitive and useful marker of oxidative DNA adducts (12).
p1999
aVIt has been shown that 8-OHdG is closely associated with various diseases, including cancer, and is produced by exposure to various carcinogens (12).
p2000
aVIt is known to cause mutations, predominantly G to T transversions (13,14).
p2001
aVOur previous research indicated that PB administered at doses from 60 to 500 p.p.m.

p2007
aVIn past studies a dose\u2013response effect of PB on the increase of the hepatic cancer was observed, exhibiting a threshold at low doses (16\u201318).
p2008
aVAnticarcinogenic effects of PB might result from stimulation of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, which detoxify carcinogens (19).
p2009
aVIn the post-initiation phase the mechanisms underlying modulation are not clear but hormesis-type responses may represent modest overcompensation to a disruption of homeostasis (20).
p2010
aVFurthermore, a number of studies have revealed that biphasic dose\u2013response appears to result from direct stimulation at low doses and inhibition at high doses without involvement of the above-mentioned compensatory responses (20).

aVIn the present study, the effects of PB application at 2, 15 and 500 p.p.m.

aV8-OHdG, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, potentially involved in carcinogenesis in various experimental models, is known to cause mutations (12\u201314,37,38).
p2177
aVInduction of a significant and steady elevation of 8-OHdG is thought to play an integral role in carcinogenesis (39).
p2178
aVSignificant increase of 8-OHdG levels in the DEN initiation group over the vehicle control observed in the present study supported this concept.
p2179
aVTherefore, the suppression of GST-P positive foci and tumor development by PB at low dose might be related to the observed reduction in 8-OHdG level in the DNA of hepatocytes.
p2180
aVConspicuous increase of GST-P positive foci numbers and areas after 10 weeks of PB administration at a dose of 500 p.p.m., on the other hand, was associated with elevation of intracellular OH\u2022 and 8-OHdG levels in the rat liver DNA.
p2181
aVEnhanced protein and activity levels of P-450 isoenzymes CYP2B1/2 and CYP3A2 might be related to accumulation of OH\u2022 and 8-OHdG with the high dose (21).
p2182
aVThe induction of OGG1 mRNA expression observed in this study suggested that a reason for the 8-OHdG decrease in the background liver parenchyma in the low dose group might have been activation of 8-OHdG repair.
p2183
aVThis has been shown to be elevated in response to DNA damage generated by hydroxyl radicals and is attributable to glycosylases, endonucleases and lyase activity (40,41).
p2184

p2189
aVand markedly enhanced by the high dose treatment.
p2190
aVIt is thus possible that Ogg1, induced by generation of OH\u2022, might swing the balance between generation and elimination of 8-OHdG in DNA.
p2191
aVHydroxyl radicals and 8-OHdG levels were presumably very high due to the increase of cytochrome P-450 CYP2B1/2 and CYP3A2 in the livers of rats treated with PB at a dose of 500 p.p.m., and the repair of oxidative base modifications was insufficient to prevent the elevation of 8-OHdG.

aVHowever, the PCNA index was significantly suppressed with the low dose.
p2195
aVAs detected by cDNA microarray analysis, PB treatment at low dose enhanced gene expression of GAD65, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of GABA.
p2196
aVFurthermore, the expression of GAD65 was reduced in the livers of animals of the initiation group as compared with the vehicle control, but no significant differences in GAD65 expression were observed in 15 and 500 p.p.m.

aVdose groups.
p2198
aVTherefore, the induction of GAD65 might be specific for PB activity at a dose of 2 p.p.m.
p2199
aVRecently, it has been reported about the negative correlation between the expression of GABA-A receptors in hepatocytes and thymidine incorporation in liver specimens but without evidence of causal relationship, and GABA-B receptor subtype involvement in mechanisms of hepatocyte DNA synthesis and mediation of growth stimulation (42\u201344).
p2200
aVTherefore, the increased mRNA expression of GAD65 by the low dose of PB observed in the present study may reflect something interesting; however, the role of GABA and the subtypes of GABA receptors in liver proliferation is not at all clear and needs further investigation.
p2201
aVFurthermore, suppression of gene expression of signal transduction modulators, such as MAP kinase p38, Lyn tyrosine kinase, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and rac-beta serine/threonine kinase detected with the use of cDNA microarray analysis might have been related to the inhibitory effect of PB on cell proliferation.

p2213
aVA reduction of apoptosis in the normal-appearing liver tissue surrounding the GST-P positive foci due to the inhibition of oxidative DNA damage after treatment with low dose PB might suppress their enlargement.
p2214
aVApoptosis of the normal-appearing tissue might be one of the factors regulating the size of foci, as the enlargement of GST-P positive foci probably is more difficult in the case of non-apoptotic surrounding tissue.
p2215
aVThe results of the immunohistochemical examination of GST-P, ssDNA and 8-OHdG in serial sections showed that 8-OHdG and ssDNA positive hepatocytes were located in the same area.
p2216
aVFurthermore, in our previous study, double immunohistochemistry for 8-OHdG and apoptosis in the livers of rats treated for 8 days with PB at a dose of 500 p.p.m.
p2217
aVrevealed high levels of concordance between induction of 8-OHdG and apoptosis (ssDNA) (21).
p2218
aVThus, the data of the present experiment are in agreement with our previous results.
p2219
aVMoreover, recently, depression of apoptosis by PB has been explained on the basis of its ability to inhibit p53 (48), p21WAF1/Cip1 (49), and enhance bcl-2 gene family expression (50).
p2220
aVPB may also co-operate with c-myc and TGF-\u03b1 in the selective inhibition of apoptosis through diverse molecular pathways (51).
p2221
aVA decrease of P-450 expression in liver nodules induced by DEN has been found as compared with the normal tissue (52).
p2222
aVThe data are consistent with the results of the present experiment showing a reduction of P-450 total content in the liver microsomal fraction of the DEN control animals.
p2223
aVFurthermore, it has been reported that suppressive effect of PB on the development of pre-neoplastic lesions might be due to the stimulation of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, which detoxify carcinogens (17).
p2224
aVTherefore, activation of P-450 isoenzymes CYP2C11, CYP3A2 and OR in the liver microsomes observed in the present study after administration of PB at low dose, if not accompanied by induction of their gene expression leading to the tremendous elevation of OH\u2022, might have a protective effect.
p2225
aVNo significant differences in mRNA or protein levels of CYP3A2, CYP2B1/2 and CYP2C11 were detected in the low-dose group in both experiments, suggesting that those enzymes of the detoxification system were activated, but their gene expression was not altered.
p2226
aVIn contrast, P-450 isoenzymes mRNA and protein levels were conspicuously elevated in the high dose-treated groups, and the data were in line with the previously noted results (11).
p2227
aVIn addition, an inhibitory effect of PB on development of GST-P positive foci in a medium-term rat liver bioassay was reported previously to correlate with changes in CYP3A2 isoenzyme protein content, which was suppressed by the low and enhanced by high doses of PB (15).
p2228
aVHowever, in this study we did not observe any effect of PB at low dose either on the levels of CYP3A2 mRNA or protein expression, possibly due to differences in experimental models.
p2229
aVIn conclusion, PB, a promoter of hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents at high dose, at low dose inhibited the formation of GST-P positive foci and liver tumors.
p2230
aVOur data demonstrate the presence of a threshold for the promoting effects of PB and the lack of linearity in the low-dose area of the dose\u2013response curve, rather providing evidence of a J-shape.
p2231
aVSuppression of 8-OHdG formation and apoptosis in background normal-appearing liver parenchyma, cell proliferation in the areas of hepatic foci, and alterations in the expression of genes related to control of cell proliferation, might explain in part the hormetic inhibition of hepatocarcinogenesis by PB at low dose.

aVPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a structurally diverse group of environmental pollutants, are effective promoters in two-stage cancer models, which implies that epigenetic mechanisms are involved.
p2233
aVInhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) belongs among critical epigenetic events of tumor promotion.
p2234
aVWe determined the relative potencies of a series of environmentally relevant PCB congeners to inhibit GJIC in vitro in a rat liver epithelial cell line with pluripotent oval cell characteristics.
p2235
aVThe nonplanar PCBs were potent inhibitors of GJIC, whereas the coplanar PCBs did not inhibit GJIC.
p2236
aVWe then compared the effects of the coplanar PCB 126 (3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl) and the noncoplanar PCB 153 (2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032,5,5\u2032-hexachlorobiphenyl) with effects of two model GJIC inhibitors, a tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF).
p2237
aVIn contrast to TPA or EGF, PCB 153 elicited a long-term downregulation of GJIC (up to 48 h).
p2238
aVUsing Western blot analysis with phospho-specific antibodies, it was found that PCB 153, and not PCB 126, activated mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2; however in contrast to TPA and EGF, this activation was observed at the time points subsequent to GJIC inhibition.
p2239
aVMoreover, blocking of ERK1/2 activation did not prevent the GJIC inhibition induced by PCB 153.
p2240
aVTherefore, additional intracellular signaling pathways potentially involved in the downregulation of GJIC by PCBs were screened by using specific chemical probes inhibiting serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, and phospholipases.
p2241
aVThe inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase partially blocked and the selective inhibition of Src kinases and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) completely blocked the inhibitory effects of the noncoplanar PCB on GJIC,

aVindicating that PC-PLC or sphingomyelinase and Src might be upstream regulators of noncoplanar PCB-induced inhibition of GJIC.
p2243
aVPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of structurally diverse and persistent environmental pollutants, widely distributed as complex mixtures.
p2244
aVNon-ortho-substituted coplanar PCBs have been shown to elicit a set of adverse effects associated with the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), resulting in liver damage, thymus atrophy, skin lesions, a wasting syndrome, and tumor promotion (van den Berg et al., 1998).
p2245
aVDi-ortho-substituted PCBs, which tend to be noncoplanar structures of the biphenyl molecule that does not significantly activate AhR, exhibit a different spectrum of toxic modes of action, such as modulation of steroid hormone and Ca2+-induced intracellular signaling, and have been linked to neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and tumor promotion (Brouwer et al., 1999; Dean et al., 2002; Hansen, 1998; Robertson and Hansen, 2001).
p2246
aVSuch toxic effects suggest interactions with different cellular components other than AhR; however, exact modes of action of noncoplanar PCBs still remain unclear.
p2247
aVMechanistic studies are extremely important because of an urgent need to estimate contributions of noncoplanar congeners to overall PCB toxicity (Hansen, 1998).
p2248
aVIn the currently accepted toxic equivalency factors approach, which is based exclusively on AhR-mediated toxicity data, the more prevalent di-ortho-substituted PCBs have zero toxic potencies (van den Berg et al., 1998), despite their known toxicity.
p2249
aVWidespread distribution and persistence of PCBs led to studies on their potential role in carcinogenesis (Silberhorn et al., 1990).
p2250
aVEvidence that exposure to PCBs, as well as polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), leads to mutations has been ambiguous and controversial (Stapleton et al., 2001; Tsushimoto et al., 1983), but numerous studies indicate that PCBs and PBBs act as tumor promoters (Jensen et al., 1982; Safe, 1989; Silberhorn et al., 1990; van der Plas et al., 2000).
p2251
aVThese results imply that nongenotoxic (epigenetic) mechanisms are involved in their carcinogenic potential.
p2252
aVAlthough coplanar PCBs are supposed to play an important role in tumor-promoting effects of PCB mixtures, such as Aroclor 1260, through AhR activation, the noncoplanar fraction of this mixture also contributed significantly to its tumor-promotion potential (van der Plas et al., 2000).
p2253
aVTherefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of the nongenotoxic tumorigenic potential of the noncoplanar PCBs is essential in establishing a more accurate assessment of risk that environmentally relevant PCBs pose to human health.
p2254
aVThree critical epigenetic events are needed at the promotional stages of cancer: one being the removal of an initiated cell from the suppression of growth by neighboring cells through the intercellular transfer of signal transductants via gap junctions; the second being the activation of a mitogenic pathway such as the extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) class of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK); and the third is the inhibition of apoptosis.
p2255
aVThe downregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) by tumor-promoting compounds is considered to be a critical step in the removal of an initiated cell from the growth suppression of neighboring cells (Ruch and Trosko, 2001; Yamasaki, 1996).
p2256
aVTherefore, the inhibition of GJIC can be assumed to be a representative marker of tumor-promoting potency for a given compound (Rosenkrantz et al., 2000).
p2257
aVPBBs were the first polyhalogenated biphenyls shown to inhibit GJIC (Trosko et al., 1981), and a subsequent study demonstrated that the chlorinated isomers of the biphenyls inhibited GJIC in a manner similar to their brominated analogues (Tsushimoto et al., 1983).
p2258
aVNumerous studies have since demonstrated that several PCBs can inhibit GJIC, both in vivo (Bager et al., 1997; Dean et al., 2002; Haag-Grönlund et al., 1998; van der Plas et al., 2000) and in vitro in rat liver epithelial cells, mouse and rat hepatocytes, human keratinocytes, and normal human breast epithelial cells (Hemming et al., 1991; Kang et al., 1996; Ruch and Klaunig, 1986; Swierenga et al., 1990).
p2259
aVAlthough relative potencies of a number of PCBs to inhibit GJIC have been reported (Hemming et al., 1991), there are still many PCB congeners occurring in the environment, where this important information is missing.
p2260
aVThe mechanism by which PCBs inhibit GJIC is not known.
p2261
aVIn general, the intracellular signals involved in acute inhibition of GJIC are still poorly understood; only the mechanisms of prototypical GJIC inhibitors, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), have been studied in some detail (Lau et al., 1992; Matesic et al., 1994; Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001; Warn-Cramer et al., 1998).
p2262
aVEGF-induced inhibition of GJIC has been associated with the activation of the membrane-bound EGF receptor (EGFR)\u2013Ras\u2013Raf\u2013MEK\u2013ERK1/2 signal transduction cascade, and TPA-induced inhibition of GJIC has been associated with the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) followed by the consequent activation of ERK1/2.
p2263
aVPretreatment of cells with specific MAPK or PKC inhibitors has been demonstrated to prevent EGF or TPA-induced inhibition of GJIC (Husoy et al., 2001; Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001; Ruch et al., 2001).
p2264
aVWhile the inhibition of GJIC by either TPA or EGF are MEK-dependent, the activation of MEK and ERK alone is insufficient for the inhibition of GJIC (Hossain et al., 1999; Rummel et al., 1999).
p2265
aVFurthermore, not all compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, inhibit GJIC through MEK-dependent pathways, even though these compounds can activate MAPK (Rummel et al., 1999).

aVWang and Loch-Caruso, 2002) have been implicated in the mechanism of GJIC inhibition.
p2268
aVInvolvement of these signaling pathways in PCB-induced inhibition of GJIC has yet to be determined.
p2269
aVThe aims of the present study were to determine relative potencies of a series of environmentally relevant PCB congeners to inhibit GJIC in vitro in a rat liver epithelial cell line with pluripotent oval cell characteristics.
p2270
aVWe then compared the effects of the coplanar PCB 126 (3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl) and the noncoplanar PCB 153 (2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032,5,5\u2032-hexachlorobiphenyl) on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2.
p2271
aVFinally, we used specific chemical probes that inhibit protein kinases and phospholipases to screen the intracellular signaling pathways potentially involved in the downregulation of GJIC by noncoplanar PCBs and compared these results with effects of prototypical GJIC inhibitors.

aVPCB congeners were purchased from Promochem, with exception of PCB18, which was a generous gift from Dr. Hansen (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL), and PCBs 70 and 74 obtained from Dr. Lehmler (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA).

aVWB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells (Tsao et al., 1984) were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic), supplemented with pyruvate (110 mg/l), 10 mM HEPES, and 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic).
p2277
aVConfluent cells, grown in 24-well plates, were exposed to various concentrations of individual PCB congeners (up to 100 \u03bcM) or solvent (DMSO, 0.1%, v/v) for 30 min.
p2278
aVFor the study of acute and sustained downregulation of GJIC, prolonged 24- or 48-h exposure to TPA, coplanar PCB 126, or noncoplanar di-ortho-chlorinated PCB 153 were used.
p2279
aVThe model tumor promoter, TPA, and endogenous peptide, EGF, were used as prototypical inhibitors of GJIC.
p2280
aVModes of action of GJIC inhibitors were studied in the cells pretreated for 20 min (if not indicated otherwise) with selective inhibitors or activators of intracellular protein kinases or phospholipases followed by the 30-min exposure to a compound under study (PCB 153, TPA, or EGF).
p2281
aVTyrosine kinases were inhibited by 30-min pretreatment with 50 \u03bcM genistein, 10 \u03bcM AG1478, 50 \u03bcM AG829, 5 \u03bcM AG879, or 50 \u03bcM PP2, selective inhibitors of EGF receptor (EGFR), Neu/ErbB-2, nerve growth factor receptor, and Src kinases, respectively.
p2282
aVInhibition of MEK1/2, p38 MAPK, and phosphoinositol triphosphate kinase (PI3 K) were performed by a 30-minute preincubation with 20 \u03bcM U0126, 10 \u03bcM SB203,580, and 25 \u03bcM LY294002, respectively.
p2283
aVActivation of PKCs was blocked by 30-min pretreatment with 5 \u03bcM GF109203X, a general inhibitor of PKCs, or by a 24-h pretreatment with 20 nM TPA, inducing PKC depletion.
p2284
aVProtein kinase A (PKA) was inhibited by treating the WB cells with 10 \u03bcM H-89 and activated by 5 mM 8-bromo-cAMP or 40 \u03bcM forskolin (30-min pretreatment).
p2285
aVSeveral PLA2 and PLC inhibitors were used to test the involvement of phospholipase(s) in inhibition of GJIC after exposure to PCB153.
p2286
aVMethyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (AACOCF3), inhibitors of IV4A-PLA2 and VIA-PLA2, were used in 1.25 and 10 \u03bcM concentrations, respectively; 2.5 \u03bcM bromoenol lactone (BEL), a specific inhibitor of VI-PLA2, 10 \u03bcM MJ33 inhibiting preferentially acidic iPLA2, 5 \u03bcM p-bromophenacyl bromide (BrPhBr), which selectively inhibits secretory PLA2 isoenzymes, 2.5 \u03bcM U73122 and 40 \u03bcM ET-18-OCH3, two inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (PI-PLC), 40 \u03bcM xanthogenate tricyclodecan-9-yl (D609), which blocks phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (PC-PLC) and sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities, and 20 \u03bcM RHC 80267, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase, were used to selectively inhibit major known intracellular protein kinase and phospholipase signal transduction segments.
p2287
aVInhibitor concentrations were selected according to previously published data on the use of specific inhibitors in various in vitro systems, including rat liver oval cells.
p2288
aVSeveral inhibitors, namely PP2, genistein, and H-89, were tested at least at three different concentrations.
p2289
aVThe chemical inhibitors themselves did not affect GJIC, with exception of AG879, U73122, BrPhBr, BEL, MJ33, and MAFP, which reduced GJIC at the lowest effective concentrations 15, 5, 10, 5, 20, and 5 \u03bcM, respectively.
p2290
aVAfter exposure, a modified protocol of scrape-loading/dye transfer technique (Bláha et al., 2002; El Fouly et al., 1987) was used to assess in vitro modulations of GJIC.
p2291
aVThe cells were washed twice by phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), fluorescent dye was added (lucifer yellow, 0.05% w/v in PBS), and the cells were scraped using a surgical steel blade.

p2297
aVCells were grown to the same confluency as for the SL/DT assay and then deprived of serum for 18\u201324 h to synchronize the cells and to reduce the background levels of ERK activity.
p2298
aVPCB 153 inhibited GJIC at the same dose and time as in serum sufficient cells.
p2299
aVExtraction and SDS\u2013PAGE separation of proteins was performed according to the method of Rummel et al.(1999).
p2300
aVThe protein concentration was determined with BioRad DC protein kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA), and 15 \u03bcg of protein was loaded for each sample.
p2301
aVThe equal loading was verified by staining the blots with Ponceau S. Phosphorylated ERK 1 and ERK 2 were detected with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-phospho-ERK polyclonal antibodies for 24 h (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA).
p2302
aVThe protein-primary antibody complex was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Life Science Products, Arlington Heights, IL) for 1 h.

aVand the inhibitory effect of the noncoplanar PCB 153 and the lack of an inhibitory effect by the coplanar PCB 126 are shown in the fluorescent micrographs of Figure 1A.
p2309
aVInhibition of GJIC by PCB153 occurred within 15 min (Fig.
p2310
aV1B).
p2311
aVThe acute GJIC inhibitory potencies were determined for a series of 37 total environmentally occurring PCB congeners (Table 1).
p2312
aVThe IC50 values of the inhibiting compounds ranged within one order of magnitude (mostly between 10 and 25 \u03bcM),
p2313
aVthe result corresponding to previous findings with PCBs (Hemmings et al., 1991) or other organic environmental pollutants, e.g., DDT (Ren et al., 1998; Ruch et al., 1994; Wärngard et al., 1989), lindane (Leibold and Schwarz, 1993) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Bláha et al., 2002; Upham et al., 1998).
p2314
aVThe noncoplanar tri- to hexachlorobiphenyls with chlorine substitutions at the ortho-position, such as PCB 153, were found to be potent inhibitors of GJIC.
p2315
aVThe most potent di-ortho-substituted PCB 47 elicited inhibiton of GJIC with IC50 being 10.1 \u03bcM.
p2316
aVAlso mono-ortho-chlorinated congeners showed similar potency to inhibit GJIC in the rat liver epithelial cells.
p2317
aVHigh-molecular-weight hepta- and octachlorinated congeners and the non-ortho substituted PCBs elicited minimal or zero inhibition in the WB-F344 cells (Table 1, Figs.
p2318
aV1 and 2).
p2319
aVWe next investigated inhibition of GJIC by di-ortho-substituted noncoplanar PCB 153, coplanar PCB 126, or TPA during prolonged 24-h or 48-h exposure (Fig.
p2320
aV3).
p2321
aVThe transient inhibitory effect of the TPA and the recovery of GJIC after the prolonged exposure was observed as previously reported (Ren et al., 1998; Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001).
p2322
aVOn the other hand, PCB 153 induced a long-term downregulation of gap junction function between adjacent cells after 24 and 48 h within the same concentration range as was found after the acute 30-min treatment.
p2323
aVCoplanar PCB 126 had no significant inhibitory effect on GJIC after 30 min, 24 h, or 48 h. Cytotoxicity was observed only after prolonged exposure to PCB 126 at the highest concentration (100 \u03bcM).
p2324
aVTwo prototypical PCB congeners, Nos.
p2325
aV126 and 153, were selected for the study.
p2326
aVThe coplanar PCB 126 did not alter the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 as compared to the DMSO vehicle (Fig.
p2327
aV4), although slight differences in the phosphorylation status of ERK proteins were observed even with the vehicle control, probably due to high sensitivity of WB-F344 cells to manipulation (unpublished data).
p2328
aVIn contrast, the noncoplanar PCB 153 significantly activated ERK1/2 at 60 and 80 min (Fig.
p2329
aV4).
p2330
aVActivation occurred after inhibition of GJIC,
p2331
aVwhich is similar to the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Rummel et al., 1999).
p2332
aVIn contrast to TPA, no apparent hyperphosphorylation of connexin43, which is a principal constituent of gap junction channels in WB-F344 cells, was observedafter PCB 153 treatment (data not shown).
p2333
aVThese and the above results indicate that inhibition of GJIC by PCB153 is independent of MAPK and differs from the reported mechanisms of TPA and EGF action (Hossain et al., 1999; Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001; Warn-Cramer et al., 1998).
p2334
aVA combination of pretreatment with several selective inhibitors or other modulators of protein kinases and phospholipases, and exposure to EGF, TPA, or PCB 153 followed by the determination of GJIC was used to compare possible mode(s) of action of noncoplanar PCB with those of TPA and EGF (see Tables 2 and 3).
p2335
aVThe major components of intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in acute inhibition of prototypical compounds TPA or EGF have been previously reported.
p2336
aVEGF blocks GJIC by the direct activation of EGF receptor and consequent activation of MEK1/2\u2013ERK1/2 signaling pathway; TPA inhibits GJIC via the activation of PKC and by indirect activation of MEK1/2\u2013ERK1/2 (Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001; Ruch et al., 2001).
p2337
aVOur study confirmed these findings; the pretreatment of the cells with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, completely prevented the effect of both reference compounds.
p2338
aVIn addition, the pretreatment of the cells with AG1478, a selective inhibitor of membrane EGF receptor, prevented the inhibitory effect of the EGF on GJIC, while inhibition of PKC by GF109203X, as well as PKC depletion by prolonged 24-h pretreatment with TPA, prevented the downregulation of GJIC after TPA exposure (Table 2).
p2339
aVHowever, neither U0126 nor GF109203X blocked PCB 153-induced inhibition of GJIC (Table 2).
p2340
aVTherefore, effects of inhibitors/activators of several additional protein kinases were investigated.
p2341
aVThese included receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-2 (reported to be a target of organochlorine pesticides in some cellular models; see Hatakeyama and Matsumura, 1999; Tessier and Matsumura, 2001), nerve growth factor receptor, src tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, or PKA.
p2342
aVGenistein, a nonspecific inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, significantly, although not completely, blocked the inhibition of GJIC (Fig.
p2343
aV5).
p2344
aVNone of other chemical inhibitors of protein kinases was able to block inhibition of GJIC after PCB 153 treatment with the exception of PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src, and H-89,
p2345
aVa compound reported to be a potent inhibitor of PKA (Table 2).
p2346
aVHowever, pretreatment of the WB-F344 cells with specific PKA activators, forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP, did not cause inhibition of GJIC;
p2347
aVtherefore, a possible role for PKA in signal transduction leading to downregulation of GJIC was not confirmed.
p2348
aVThese data seem to suggest that PCB congeners operate by a different mechanism than the prototypical GJIC inhibitors TPA and EGF.
p2349
aVNeither the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases under study (ERK1/2, p38, PI3-K, PKA) nor GF106203X-sensitive PKCs are probably involved in downregulation of GJIC observed after PCB 153 treatment in the WB-F344 cells.
p2350
aVPCBs or other organochlorines have been previously shown to activate PLA2 or PLC in rat neutrophils and several other cell types (Shin et al., 2002; Tithof et al., 1997; Wang and Loch-Caruso, 2002).
p2351
aVTherefore, in this study a series of selective inhibitors of PLA2 isoenzymes, PI-PLC, and PC-PLC were investigated for potential effects on downregulation of GJIC by PCB 153 or TPA (Table 3).
p2352
aVPLA2 inhibitors did not prevent but rather caused a slight increase in TPA- and PCB 153-induced inhibition of GJIC.
p2353
aVSimilarly, two PI-PLC inhibitors, U73122 and ET-18-OCH3, had no effect on GJIC inhibition.
p2354
aVOn the other hand, an inhibitor of PC-PLC, sphingomyelin synthase and SMase, D-609, prevented inhibition of GJIC.
p2355
aVRHC 80267, a specific inhibitor of DAG lipase, an enzyme operating downstream of PLC isozymes, partially blocked the inhibition of GJIC by PCB 153 (Table 3).
p2356
aVInterestingly, these compounds also blocked TPA inhibition of GJIC when concentrations of TPA was lower than 10 nM (Table 2).
p2357
aVImbalance in tissue homeostasis due to disruption of cell-to-cell communication has been linked to growth and developmental diseases, such as cancer.
p2358
aVAlthough there are many critical molecular events involved in maintaining homeostasis, considerable data accumulated over the last two decades indicate that intercellular communication through gap junctions plays an important role (Ruch and Trosko, 2001).
p2359
aVNumerous studies have linked the interruption of GJIC, by either oncogenes or tumor promoters, with cancer, indicating that GJIC might be an important, albeit insufficient step of tumor promotion (Ruch et al., 2001).
p2360
aVIn addition to the removal of an initiated cell from growth suppression, mitogenic signal transduction pathways are also required for tumorigenesis.
p2361
aVTherefore it is not surprising that PCBs were also shown to induce MAP kinase signal transduction pathways in our cell system, as well as activation of transcription factors such as AhR, NFkB, AP-1, or oxidative stress in other cell systems (reviewed in Glaubert et al., 2001), although their modes of mitogenic action are not sufficiently characterized.
p2362
aVBoth coplanar and noncoplanar PCB congeners have been shown to elicit hepatic tumor-promoting effects in rats (Buchmann et al., 1986; Dean et al., 2002; Glaubert et al., 2001), however at least one ortho-chlorine appeared to be essential for eliciting the inhibition of GJIC in rat liver epithelial cells (Hemming et al., 1991).
p2363
aVMono-ortho-substituted PCB114 and also PCB153 inhibited GJIC in human liver cells and keratinocytes, while coplanar PCB77 elicited no inhibition of GJIC (Swierenga et al., 1990).
p2364
aVOn the other hand, coplanar PCBs inhibited GJIC in mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa-1, and the AhR might be involved in this effect (De Haan et al., 1994).
p2365
aVApparent relationships between the structure and the acute inhibition of GJIC by PCB congeners were also found in the present study.
p2366
aVThe noncoplanar tri- to hexachlorobiphenyls with chlorine substitutions at the ortho-position, such as PCB153, were found to be potent inhibitors of GJIC, and the mono-ortho-chlorinated congeners showed similar potency to inhibit GJIC in the rat liver epithelial cells (Table 1).
p2367
aVImportantly, the inhibition of GJIC by prototypical noncoplanar PCB153 was not transient and lasted as long as 48 h (Fig.
p2368
aV2).
p2369
aVThe short time period of 15 min required for inhibition of GJIC indicated that posttranslational modification of the gap junctions was the most probable effect.
p2370
aVOn the other hand, high-molecular-weight hepta- and octachlorinated congeners elicited minimal or no inhibition.
p2371
aVThe non-ortho-substituted PCBs, which are potent AhR inducers, such as PCB126, had no inhibitory effect on GJIC in the WB-F344 cells, even after prolonged exposure (Fig.
p2372
aV2).
p2373
aVThese findings confirmed previously reported effects of several noncoplanar, mono-ortho-substituted and coplanar PCBs in the same rat liver epithelial cell line (Hemming et al., 1991).
p2374
aVWe have identified in the present study a number of environmentally relevant PCB congeners that are also potent GJIC inhibitors, including PCBs 18, 47, 74, 114, 149, 163, 180, and 187 as well as other PCB congeners Nos.
p2375
aV110, 119, 123, 129, 157 occurring in the environment at significant concentrations (Rose et al., 2002; Hansen, 1998).
p2376
aVThe difference between the effects of coplanar PCB congeners on the liver epithelial (oval-like) cells used in our system and hepatocyte-type cells (De Haan et al., 1994) might be related to the fact that the two cell types express different connexin proteins.
p2377
aVWhile the oval cells express connexin 43, mature hepatocytes express connexin 26 and 32 as their predominant gap junction protein (Zhang and Thorgeirsson, 1994).
p2378
aVAhR ligands, such as 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), are known to decrease GJIC in isolated hepatocytes, and this effect is probably related to AhR-controlled downregulation of connexin32 mRNA (Baker et al., 1995; Herrmann et al., 2002).
p2379
aVCell context has been also suggested to play a decisive role in effects of potential GJIC inhibitors, based on the fact that cell-specific, rather than connexin-specific inhibition by TPA, p,p\u2032-DDT, or phenobarbital has been observed (Ren et al., 1998).
p2380
aVThus, while noncoplanar PCBs could inhibit GJIC in oval stem-like liver epithelial cells (this study), hepatocytes might be a target of inhibitory action of coplanar PCBs (De Haan et al., 1994).
p2381
aVAn importance of the cellular context for inhibition of GJIC by noncoplanar and coplanar PCBs is supported by the fact that coplanar PCBs did not affect GJIC in the rat liver epithelial cells WB-F344, although inducible AhR is probably present in these cells.
p2382
aVThe presence of functional AhR and P450-dependent monooxygenase activities in rat liver epithelial cells has been questioned (Herrmann et al., 2002; Schrenk et al., 1991).
p2383
aVHowever, it has been shown that WB-F344 cells contain dioxin-inducible EROD activity (Köhle et al., 1999), and we have found that both TCDD and PAHs, known as AhR ligands, are able to induce CYP1A-dependent activity in this cellular model, which was inhibited by a specific inhibitor, \u03b1-naphthoflavone (unpublished data).
p2384
aVThis seems to suggest a presence of functional AhR in this cellular model.
p2385
aVHowever, a possible role of chaperon complexes of AhR and other transcription factors such as CAR, which is known to be activated by noncoplanar PCBs, has not been currently studied in immediate intracellular events (Pascussi et al., 2003).
p2386
aVAlthough the inhibitory effects of noncoplanar PCBs on GJIC have been reported from various in vitro and in vivo systems, the mechanism(s) of their action is still unknown.
p2387
aVThe set of selective chemical inhibitors of protein kinases and phospholipases was used to identify the regulatory mechanisms of intracellular signaling pathways responsible for inhibition of GJIC.
p2388
aVNoncoplanar PCB 153, as well as model prototypical inhibitors of GJIC, TPA, and EGF were selected for this comparative study.
p2389
aVThe participation of the EGF receptor\u2013Ras\u2013Raf\u2013MEK1/2\u2013ERK ½ signal transduction pathway in inhibition of GJIC by EGF is well documented (Kanemitsu and Lau, 1993; Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001; Ruch et al., 2001; Warn-Cramer et al., 1998), and our data were consistent with this model.
p2390
aVIt is believed that TPA blocks GJIC mainly by a direct action of PKC, but also partly through cross-talk with the ERK1/2 pathway (Oh et al., 1991; Ren et al., 1998; Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001).
p2391
aVIn this study, the specific inhibitor of EGFR (AG1478) blocked inhibition of GJIC after treatment with EGF; the general inhibitor of conventional and novel PKCs, GF109203X, prevented the GJIC inhibition after exposure to TPA.
p2392
aVThe MEK inhibitor U0126 prevented inhibition of GJIC caused by both TPA and EGF (Table 2).
p2393
aVFrom our data, it seems evident that a prototypical noncoplanar PCB 153 operates by a mode of action independent of ERK1/2 or PKC activation.
p2394
aVAlthough PCB 153 activated ERK1/2, the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 were detected subsequently to inhibition of GJIC.
p2395
aVThis sequence of events is similar to the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Rummel et al., 1999).
p2396
aVMoreover, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation, U0126, did not affect the inhibitory potency of PCB 153.
p2397
aVNo apparent hyperphosphorylation of connexin43, which is a principal constituent of gap junction channels in WB-F344 cells and becomes phosphorylated after EGF or TPA treatment, was induced by PCB 153 (data not shown).
p2398
aVThese results indicate that inhibition of GJIC by PCB 153 is independent of ERK1/2.
p2399
aVSimilarly, inhibitors of other protein kinases, including PI3K, p38, and the general inhibitor of PKC, did not modulate the inhibition of GJIC by PCB 153.
p2400
aVIn contrast, the inhibitory effect of PCB 153 was partially blocked by genistein, a nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and a strong prevention was found also after pretreatment with a high concentration of PP2, an inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase.
p2401
aVThis seems to suggest an involvement of tyrosine kinase in effects of PCB 153, which remains to be specified.
p2402
aVHowever, pretreatment with specific inhibitors of selected receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR, ErbB2/Neu, and NGFR, did not prevent GJIC inhibition by PCB 153 (Table 2).
p2403
aVH-89, a widely used inhibitor of intracellular PKA, blocked inhibition of GJIC after treatment with PCB 153.
p2404
aVHowever in our study, the activation of PKA by forskolin or the brominated analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) was not associated with inhibition of GJIC (Table 2).
p2405
aVTherefore, we can conclude either that PKA was not involved in inhibition of GJIC after treatment with PCB 153 and prevention by H-89 was probably due to a broader inhibition specificity of H-89, or that cAMP alone is insufficient to activate the appropriate combination of signaling pathways needed to inhibit GJIC.
p2406
aVSpecificities of many inhibitors of protein kinases and probably also phospholipases have not been tested sufficiently (Davies et al., 2000), and it is necessary to be careful when the data from inhibitory studies are interpreted.
p2407
aVFor example, H-89 has been reported to selectively antagonize beta adrenergic receptors and other G protein-coupled receptors (Penn et al., 1999).
p2408
aVNotably, G protein-coupled receptor agonists, such as lysophosphatidic acid, rapidly disrupt GJIC by activation of Src tyrosine kinase (Giepmans et al., 2001; Postma et al., 1998) or Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway (Warn-Cramer et al., 1998).
p2409
aVAnother important group of enzymes involved in intracellular signaling are phospholipases and lipases, such as PLA2 isozymes, PI-PLC, PC-PLC or diacylglycerol (DAG)-lipase (Nozawa, 2002).
p2410
aVPCBs have been reported to activate PLA2 or PLC in various cell types (Shin et al., 2002; Tithof et al., 1997; Wang and Loch-Caruso, 2002).
p2411
aVIn the present study, the inhibitor of PC-PLC, D609, strongly blocked downregulation of GJIC, while a series of PLA2 and PI-PLC inhibitors failed to prevent inhibition of GJIC by PCB 153 (Table 3).
p2412
aVIn addition, DAG lipase inhibitor RHC 80267 also partially blocked GJIC inhibition induced by PCB 153, which suggests a potential role for DAG lipase products in the inhibitory mode(s) of action of noncoplanar PCB 153.
p2413
aVUnlike some bacterial analogues, the mammalian PC-PLC has not yet been characterized at the molecular and regulatory levels.
p2414
aVTherefore, the exact role of PC-PLC in signal transduction remains to be defined, and all the published studies are based on the use of D609, its putative inhibitor (Nozawa, 2002).
p2415
aVD609 is considered to be a specific inhibitor of PC-PLC activity, since it has been reported not to interfere with activities of PI-PLC, PLA2, or PLD (Amtmann, 1996).
p2416
aVD609 has been reported to also inhibit sphingomyelin synthase activity, which modulates DAG/ceramide ratio with resulting significant effects on proliferation and apoptosis (Luberto and Hannun, 1998) and SMase activity.
p2417
aVIt is currently not known whether sphingomyelin synthase and PC-PLC activities are due to the same or different enzymes (Ohanian and Ohanian, 2001).
p2418
aVInterestingly, a partial inhibition of GJIC by low TPA concentrations was also prevented by H-89, PP2, D609, or RHC 80267, suggesting that low doses of TPA might operate through a slightly different mechanism than solely by the previously reported activation of phorbol ester-dependent PKC isoenzymes (Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001; Ruch et al., 2001).
p2419
aVIn conclusion, a series of environmentally relevant mono-ortho- and di-ortho-substituted PCBs caused the inhibition of GJIC in the rat liver epithelial (oval-like) cells; this cell line was not a direct target of disruption of intercellular communication by coplanar PCB congeners.
p2420
aVIn contrast to prototypical inhibitors of GJIC, TPA, and EGF, noncoplanar PCB153 elicited a potent inhibition of GJIC by a different mode of action, which probably does not involve activation of PKC or ERK1/2.
p2421
aVUsing selective chemical inhibitors of signal transduction pathways revealed that PC-PLC, Src, and DAG lipase might be involved in the GJIC inhibitory effect of PCBs.

aVAims: To describe the long term mortality experience of a cohort of 2187 male chemical production workers previously exposed to substantial levels of dioxin.
p2423
aVMethods: Vital status for a previously identified cohort was determined for an additional 10 years, to 1995.
p2424
aVDioxin exposures took place before 1983 and were sufficient to result in chloracne in 245 individuals.
p2425
aVMortality rates were compared with national figures and with a large pool of co-workers in unrelated production jobs.
p2426
aVResults: All cancers combined (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1) and lung cancer (SMR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.1) were at or below expected levels.
p2427
aVRates for soft tissue sarcoma (SMR = 2.4, 95% CI 0.3 to 8.6) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (SMR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.7) were greater than expected overall, but below expectation in the update period.
p2428
aVNo trend of increasing risk with increasing exposure was observed for these cancers.
p2429
aVWorkers who developed chloracne had very low all-cancer rates (SMR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0), and lung cancer rates (SMR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.1).
p2430
aVConclusions: We found no coherent evidence of increased cancer risk from dioxin exposure in this cohort.
p2431
aVOur study highlights the wide range of cancer rates and the lack of consistency across dioxin studies.
p2432
aVRecently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as a proven human carcinogen, based on animal studies and mechanistic information.
p2433
aVHowever, the epidemiology evidence on carcinogenicity was determined to be limited.1 Increased risk of lung cancer, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL), soft tissue sarcoma (STS), and all cancers combined were observed in some but not all studies of persons with substantial dioxin exposures.2\u20135
p2434
aVWe report on the third update of the mortality experience of 2187 Dow Chemical Company workers who were likely exposed to substantial levels of dioxin.
p2435
aVExposure determinations were developed through industrial hygiene monitoring and analysis of historical plant operations, combined with complete detailed work histories of all cohort members.
p2436
aVFor many subjects, diagnosed cases of chloracne could be traced directly to particular high exposure incidents; hence, we believe the degree of exposure within the cohort in general is corroborated by the 245 or more documented reports of chloracne.6\u20139
p2437
aVWhen follow up of the Dow Chemical Company cohort of 2187 male dioxin exposed workers was extended an additional 10 years, mortality from all cancers combined occurred at background levels, but lung cancer deaths were 20% fewer than expected.
p2438
aVNo additional deaths from soft tissue sarcoma occurred, and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma mortality declined.
p2439
aVThere was no coherent evidence of a link between dioxin and cancer(s) in this cohort.
p2440
aVThe diversity of outcomes among this study, other published research, and the cohorts contributing to the NIOSH Dioxin Registry and the IARC multinational study suggests that no single agent is likely to be the cause of all the cancers commonly attributed to dioxins.
p2441
aVMost of the workers in our study are also included in both the IARC International Study and the NIOSH Dioxin Registry, contributing 45% of the person-years of the latter.2 Aside from being the largest component, the Dow cohort has the longest follow up (that is, a maximum of 55 years) of any plant study group in either of these combined studies.
p2442
aVThe current update provides an opportunity to examine the consistency of findings from multi-plant studies by NIOSH and IARC with our study group.
p2443
aVDetails of worker selection and exposure classification have been described elsewhere.9
p2444
aVBriefly, work records were used to identify 2187 males who had worked in any of the production areas with potential dioxin exposure.
p2445
aVAll of the production units involved had ceased operations prior to 1983.
p2446
aVFive female workers were excluded from analyses.
p2447
aVAll of the females were alive at the close of the study; one was retired, while the other four were still active employees.
p2448
aVDescriptions of tasks performed in each of 500-plus jobs with potential exposure were drafted.
p2449
aVVapour phase chromatography provided estimates of TCDD concentrations in process streams and intermediate or end products from five production areas, as summarised by Ott and colleagues.9 Additionally, 2282 rabbit ear bioassays for chloracnegenic response were conducted.
p2450
aVEach job title was assigned a TCDD exposure score of 0\u20134 based on the above data, industrial hygiene monitoring, description of job duties, process flow diagrams, and assessment of major production process changes.
p2451
aVAn increase in one score unit was considered equivalent to a tenfold relative increase in TCDD exposure intensity.
p2452
aVBiomonitoring data were not available for this cohort.
p2453
aVDiagnoses of chloracne were made through a multilevel review of company medical records.10
p2454
aVPerson-years at risk for mortality were accumulated for each subject, beginning on the date he first worked in a job with potential exposure to dioxins, but no earlier than 1940.
p2455
aVFor the analyses of chloracne diagnosed workers, person-years were counted from the date of diagnosis.
p2456
aVVital status was followed until the end of the study period, 31 December 1994.
p2457
aVFollow up was 100% complete and death certificates were obtained for all decedents.
p2458
aVA certified nosologist coded the cause of death.
p2459
aVWe used a modified life table program to calculate standardised mortality ratio (SMR) risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) relative to the US white male population.11 A Mantel-Haenszel procedure was used to test mortality differences among cumulative exposure categories.12 A large pool of local workers with no experience in the targeted departments and who presumably had only background exposure to dioxin served as a baseline reference.
p2460
aVLinear trends in mortality across exposure groups were tested by Mantel\u2019s single degree of freedom \u03c72 procedure.13 Internal analyses were stratified by age, calendar year, and hourly/salary status.
p2461
aVTable 1 presents the original study findings of Cook et al and the three updates.6\u20139
p2462
aVWe added 15 years of follow up to the original study and 10 years to the last update.
p2463
aVWhile results of the original study were based on 61 cancer deaths, the current update examined 168 deaths from cancer.
p2464
aVAs in previous studies of these workers, total mortality in the most recent update was less than expected (SMR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.0).
p2465
aVAll cancers combined (SMR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1) and lung cancer (SMR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.1) were at or below expected levels, but STS (SMR = 2.4 95% CI 0.3 to 8.6) and NHL (SMR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.7) were greater than expected.
p2466
aVNo STS deaths occurred in the most recent update period, thus reducing the relative risk from 5.0 in the Bond et al study to 2.4 in the present study.
p2467
aVSince 1984, two additional deaths from NHL occurred, whereas 2.9 were expected.
p2468
aVRisk estimates for stomach cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.7) and prostate cancer (SMR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.6) were greater than 1.0, while those for bladder cancer (SMR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.0) and cancer of the brain and other central nervous system (SMR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.8) were less than 1.0 (not shown).
p2469
aVApplying a 25 year induction-latency period to the analyses did not appreciably change the findings (not shown).
p2470
aVThe 245 workers with chloracne generally had lower death rates than the comparison group (not shown).
p2471
aVThe SMR for all causes was 0.7 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.9, 51 observed), all cancers was 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.0, 10 observed), lung cancer was 0.3 (95% CI 0.0 to 1.1, two observed), STS was 10.9 (95% CI 0.3 to 61.9, one observed), and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was 0.0 (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7, 0.7 expected).
p2472
aVTable 2 shows mortality analyses by cumulative exposure categories, using internal and external comparison groups.
p2473
aVThere were no linear trends observed for any of the cancers.
p2474
aVWorkers with very high dioxin exposure had more observed than expected cancer deaths (relative risk (RR) = 1.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.0) and deaths from STS (RR = 15.8, 95% CI 5.2 to 47.8, two cases), but most other exposure categories for these cancer deaths had relative risks at or below 1.0.
p2475
aVThere were fewer lung cancer deaths than expected in the higher exposure categories, with a relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.8) in the highest group.
p2476
aVThere were only small differences in risk estimates between internal or external comparisons.
p2477
aVSeveral characteristics contribute to the importance of this cohort.
p2478
aVWe traced 2187 workers with complete follow up and job histories for an average of 30 years.
p2479
aVAlthough biomonitoring data were not available, Dow\u2019s analytical and industrial hygiene data were the most comprehensive of any in the NIOSH Dioxin Registry or the International Dioxin Study.9,14 High dioxin exposures were corroborated by clinically confirmed chloracne documented among 11% of the cohort.
p2480
aVRecent evaluations of dioxin workers have focused on total cancers, lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.
p2481
aVOf these, increased risk of lung cancer is the most consistent finding in the studies with high exposure.1
p2482
aVHowever, we find lung cancer rates at or below expected levels among all dioxin workers as well as workers with chloracne, and we find no increased risk with increasing exposure.
p2483
aVBoth the IARC multination study and NIOSH Dioxin Registry report a wide range of lung cancer risks by plant site.15,16 In the latter, SMRs for lung cancer vary from 0.7 to 2.4, but the excess risk derives mainly from two of the 12 plants.17 Risk estimates in the IARC Registry ranged from 0.0 to 3.0.
p2484
aVOther reports also provide mixed results for various groups of workers.5,18
p2485
aVAlthough sampling variation is a possible explanation for the wide range of SMRs, potential confounding at the plants with high SMRs is another possibility often mentioned.
p2486
aVDue to the unavailability of data on tobacco use, no adjustment for smoking behaviours was made in the Dow cohort.
p2487
aVHowever, since for internal comparisons both exposed and unexposed workers were drawn from a geographically and socioeconomically uniform population, confounding by smoking or other factors is likely not appreciable.
p2488
aVIn the previous update of the Dow cohort, STS was cited as the underlying cause on death certificates of two subjects, but no additional cases were ascertained in the current update.
p2489
aVAlthough there was a single case of STS among workers with chloracne, this case was in fact confirmed by pathologists to be a renal clear cell carcinoma.
p2490
aVSoft tissue sarcomas ascertained from death certificates are subject to serious misclassification error, although differential misclassification among exposed and referent populations seems unlikely.19\u201321 Nevertheless, reclassification of few cases of an uncommon cancer could have a profound impact on the overall STS risk estimates among dioxin exposed persons.
p2491
aVReports cite four instances of STS misclassification among workers in the NIOSH registry.17 Additionally, this outcome is inconsistent within the registry.
p2492
aVOnly one other of the 12 component subcohorts contributed cases to the overall total of four STS cases diagnosed on death certificates of exposed workers.
p2493
aVWe found a slight increase in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in our study,
p2494
aVsimilar to net risk estimates reported by NIOSH17 and IARC.3
p2495
aVHowever, the relative risk was not related to exposure level, and was imprecise.
p2496
aVThere were no non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma deaths among chloracne diagnosed workers, though only 0.7 were expected.
p2497
aVThis cohort contributed seven of the 10 cases of NHL reported by NIOSH,17 while three additional cohorts reported one case each.
p2498
aVThe lack of consistency across studies and our equivocal findings caution against a causal interpretation for this finding.
p2499
aVMortality from prostate cancer remained moderately increased as in previous reports.9
p2500
aVAND It was also slightly increased in the NIOSH and IARC registries,3,17 although IARC showed no difference between TCDD exposed and unexposed workers (1.11, 1.10, respectively).
p2501
aVThe degree to which these findings were influenced by the Dow cohort was not stated.
p2502
aVResults of other studies were mixed.4,22,23
p2503
aVBecause of high background incidence of prostate cancer in the general population, inconsistency of diagnosis, and the strong influence of competing risks, the evidence for an occupational aetiology for prostate cancer is not compelling.
p2504
aVWe observed cancer deaths at expected levels for the entire cohort (168 observed, 170.4 expected), but observed deaths exceeded expected deaths only in the highest cumulative exposure group (26 observed, 19.9 expected), without evidence of a trend.
p2505
aVWorkers with chloracne had a 50% deficit for all cancers combined.
p2506
aVMany studies of highly exposed dioxin workers and 8 of 12 NIOSH subcohorts report a small increase in risk for all malignant neoplasms combined, but no particular cancer site has been consistently prominent across studies.
p2507
aVA causal relation of this nature would be very unusual in occupational studies since all known carcinogens precipitate one or more cancers of specific types.
p2508
aVSome have suggested that dioxin may be a generalised carcinogenic agent which may act as a tumour promoter at multiple sites by increasing cell proliferation or inhibiting apoptosis.24 This, however, does not explain the lack of specificity seen across cohorts.
p2509
aVOthers have proposed that confounding exposures could be producing the all cancer increased risk in the dioxin cohorts.25 Given the wide range of site specific cancer risks among persons with high dioxin exposures, a single agent aetiology seems unlikely, and we favour the later hypothesis.
p2510
aVWe also agree with IARC that the findings must be treated with caution.1,3
p2511
aVThe past diagnoses of two STS cases among workers with the highest dioxin exposures is a singular occurrence that has not been clarified by our own data or other current research.
p2512
aVThe uncertainties surrounding this ill defined outcome argue for caution in assessing its aetiology.
p2513
aVDespite some unanswered questions, we find no coherent evidence that this cohort has an increased risk of cancer collectively, or of any particular type of cancer that can be attributed to dioxin exposure.
p2514
aVOur findings from the largest single study group in the NIOSH and IARC multi-plant studies also highlight the wide range of cancer rates across individual dioxin studies and the heterogeneity of findings within these multi-plant investigations.
p2515
aVIn addition to its demethylating function, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) also plays an important role in inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and cell death.
p2516
aVHowever, the mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR induces antineoplastic activity is not clear.
p2517
aVIn this study, we found that 5-aza-CdR at limited concentrations (0.01\u20135 \u03bcm) induces inhibition of cell proliferation as well as increased p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 expression in A549 cells (wild-type p53) but not in H1299 (p53-null) and H719 cells (p53 mutant).
p2518
aVThe p53-dependent p21Waf1/Cip1 expression induced by 5-aza-CdR was not seen in A549 cells transfected with the wild-type human papilloma virus type-16 E6 gene that induces p53 degradation.
p2519
aVFurthermore, deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the p21 promoter reveals that 5-aza-CdR induces p21Waf1/Cip1 expression through two p53 binding sites in the p21 promoter.
p2520
aVFinally, 5-aza-CdR-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was dependent on DNA damage but not on DNA demethylation as demonstrated by comet assay and bisulfite sequencing, respectively.
p2521
aVOur data provide useful clues for judging the therapeutic efficacy of 5-aza-CdR in the treatment of human cancer cells.
p2522
aVAs demethylating agents, 5-aza-cytidine and 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR)1 have been extensively used for epigenetic research (1\u20134).
p2523
aVBoth demethylating agents are incorporated into DNA where they bind DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) in an irreversible, covalent manner, thus sequestering the enzyme and preventing maintenance of the methylation state (5\u20137).
p2524
aVConsequently, silenced genes induced by hypermethylation are re-expressed after treatment with these demethylating agents.
p2525
aVOriginally, 5-aza-cytidine and 5-aza-CdR were developed as anticancer agents (5, 8) and have been shown to have significant cytotoxic and antineoplastic activities in many experimental tumors (9\u201312).
p2526
aV5-Aza-CdR is reported to be noncarcinogenic and incorporates into DNA but not RNA or protein (13, 14).
p2527
aV5-Aza-CdR has been found empirically to have more potent therapeutic effects than 5-aza-cytidine in cell culture and animal models of human cancers.
p2528
aVHowever, 5-aza-CdR-induced cytotoxicity may not be linked to its demethylating function (3, 15\u201317).
p2529
aVIn addition, the therapeutic effects of 5-aza-CdR in the treatment of different human cancer cells are conflicting.
p2530
aV5-Aza-CdR appears to be beneficial in the treatment of human leukemias (9, 18, 19), myelodysplastic syndromes (20, 21), and hemoglobinopathies (22, 23).
p2531
aVOn the other hand, there has been less positive experience in the effectiveness of 5-aza-CdR for the treatment of human solid tumors (10, 24).
p2532
aVTherefore, it is possible that one or more critical factors may be involved in regulating the cellular response to 5-aza-CdR treatment that vary in different cell types.
p2533
aVp53 is a very important tumor suppressor gene and is reported to be abnormal in more than 50% of human cancers (25).
p2534
aVChemotherapeutic agents frequently act through the mechanism of DNA damage, and p53 plays an important role in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage (26).
p2535
aV5-Aza-CdR has also shown anticancer activity that may be related to its ability to induce DNA damage (15, 27).
p2536
aVBased on the scenario mentioned above, it is hypothesized that 5-aza-CdR may induce DNA damage, thereby activating p53, which in turn increases p21Waf1/Cip1 expression, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation.
p2537
aVTo confirm the role of p53 in the 5-aza-CdR-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, human lung cancer cells with different p53 status were selected as the targets for this study.
p2538
aVAs an important downstream target of p53 activation, p21Waf1/Cip1 plays a critical role in inhibiting cell proliferation;
p2539
aVtherefore, p21Waf1/Cip1 expression upon treatment of 5-aza-CdR in cells with different p53 status was given special attention in this study.
p2540
aVPresent data indicated that 5-aza-CdR is a strong DNA-damaging agent, and 5-aza-CdR induces inhibition of cell proliferation by activating the p53/p21 pathway.
p2541
aVCells and Treatments\u2014Human lung cancer cell lines A549, H1299, and H719 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min) and penicillin/streptomycin, in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere and 37 °C incubator.
p2542
aVThese cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR (0.01\u201320 \u03bcm; Sigma) for up to 72 h. Fresh medium containing 5-aza-CdR was added every 24 h. The treated cells then were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, placed in drug-free medium, and harvested at 24 h after incubation at 37 °C.
p2543
aVWestern Blotting\u2014Protein expression was detected by Western blotting as previously described with minor modifications (12, 16).
p2544
aVBriefly, the cells were harvested with a scraper and then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline once.
p2545
aVThe cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.15% Igepal CA-630, and 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

aVMethylation-specific PCR and Methylation Detection\u2014DNA was extracted and then treated with bisulfite as previously described with minor modifications (29).
p2552
aVBriefly, genomic DNA (1 \u03bcg) in a volume of 50 \u03bcl was denatured by NaOH (final concentration, 0.275 m) for 10 min at 42 °C.
p2553
aVThe denatured DNA was then treated with 10 \u03bcl of 10 mm hydroquinone and 520 \u03bclof3 m sodium bisulfite at 50 °C overnight.

aVThe primers for p21 were as follows: forward primer, 5\u2032-GGG AGG AGG GAA GTG TTT TT-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-ACA ACT ACT CAC ACC TCA ACT-3\u2032.
p2555
aVThe PCR conditions were initiated with a denaturing step of 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 36 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s and were concluded with 72 °C for 7 min.

aVThe PCR products were purified with a purification kit (Qiaquick) and then incubated with HhaI (50 °C) for 2 h and TaqI at 65 °C for 2 h, respectively.

aVThe first p53 binding site, GAACA (33) (-2234 to -2230 relative to the translational start site) was replaced with GAAAC, and the second binding site, AGACT (33) (-1344 to -1340 relative to the translational start site) was replaced with AGAAT following the manufacturer's directions.

aVComet Assay for Detecting DNA Strand Breaks\u2014The comet assay, also called the single-cell gel electrophoresis, was performed as described previously (34).
p2571
aVIn brief, fully frosted microscopic slides were covered with 110 \u03bcl of 0.5% normal melting agarose at 60 °C.
p2572
aVThe slides were immediately covered with a coverslip and then kept at 4 °C for 15 min to allow the agarose to solidify.
p2573
aVAbout 105 cells of 5-aza-CdR treated or untreated cells in 40 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with equal amount (40 \u03bcl) of 1% lower melting agarose to form a cell suspension.
p2574
aVAfter gently removing the coverslip, the cell suspension was pipetted onto the first agarose layer, spread using a coverslip, and maintained at 4 °C for 15 min to allow it to solidify.
p2575
aVAfter removal of the coverslips, the slides were immersed in fresh prepared cold lysing solution (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 10.0, 1% sodium sarcosinate) with 1% Triton X-100 for 40 min at 4 °C.
p2576
aVThe slides were then placed in a horizontal gel electrophoresis tank filled with fresh electrophoresis solution (1 mm Na2EDTA, 300 mm NaOH, pH 13.0) for 10 min.
p2577
aVThe slides were then placed in Tris buffer (0.4 m Tris, pH 7.5) for 15 min twice (neutralizing the excess alkali) after electrophoresis at 4 °C.
p2578
aVThe slides were then stained with 75 \u03bcl of propidium iodide (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min.
p2579
aVThe slides were examined at 600× magnification, and the pictures were taken under a fluorescence microscope (TCS; Leica, Mannheim, Germany).
p2580
aVTo score the percentage of DNA in the tail, the image analysis system was used (Q550CW; Leica).

aVThe percentage of comet tail area (DNA tail area/total DNA area) and the comet tail length (from the center of the DNA head to the end of the DNA tail) were analyzed in 50 cells for one slide.

aVDose-dependent Inhibition of Cell Proliferation by 5-Aza-CdR\u2014In this study, human lung cancer cell lines A549 (wild-type p53), H1299 (p53-null), and H719 (mutant p53) were treated with 5-aza-CdR at different concentrations for 72 h (Fig.
p2583
aV1A) and with different intervals of 5-aza-CdR treatment at 1 \u03bcm, respectively (Fig.
p2584
aV1B).
p2585
aVThe cell viability was determined by MTT assay.
p2586
aVA dose- and duration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was observed only in A549 cells but not in H1299 and H719 cells (Fig.
p2587
aV1, A and B).
p2588
aVAs shown in Fig.
p2589
aV1A, for example, cell viability was decreased to 77% of the untreated control when A549 cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR even at very low dose (0.078 \u03bcm) and 51% or 39% of the untreated control when cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR at 1.25 or 5 \u03bcm, respectively.
p2590
aVHowever, 5-aza-CdR was unable to induce an obvious decrease in cell viability in H1299 cells or H719 cells until the concentrations were well above 1 \u03bcm (Fig.
p2591
aV1, A and B).
p2592
aVCell viability was decreased in H1299 and H719 cells only when they were treated at very high concentrations (10\u201320 \u03bcm).
p2593
aVInhibition of cell proliferation is a reflection of cell cycle arrest that is mainly controlled by proteins from the INK4 family and the CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (35).
p2594
aVA549 cells have been reported to have a homozygous deletion of CDKN2a (36).
p2595
aVTherefore, we hypothesized that p21Waf1/Cip1 expression may be a critical factor for the 5-aza-CdR-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in A549 cells.
p2596
aVFig.
p2597
aV1C indicates that increased p21Waf1/Cip1 expression is a dose-dependent effect of 5-aza-CdR treatment in A549 cells but not in H1299 cells.
p2598
aVThe increased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 was observed in the A549 cells even when treated at a very low concentration (0.01 \u03bcm) of 5-aza-CdR.
p2599
aVHowever, 5-aza-CdR even at a very high concentration (10 \u03bcm) was unable to induce increased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 in H1299 cells (Fig.
p2600
aV1C).
p2601
aVBecause p53 is a mutant in H719 cells (30), increased p21Waf1/Cip1 expression upon 5-aza-CdR treatment was similarly not observed in H719 cells in this study (data not shown).
p2602
aV5-Aza-CdR-induced Inhibition of Cell Proliferation Is Dependent on p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 Pathway\u2014To investigate whether 5-aza-CdR-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression is through activation of p53, a wild-type HPV E6 gene was inserted into pCMV-neo.
p2603
aVAfter transfection and selection with G418, the pCMV-neo-E6 stable clone (A549-E6) was established.
p2604
aVFor testing the functionality of the stable clone, the A549-E6 cells were irradiated with \u03b3-rays, and then p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 levels were determined by Western immunoblot analysis.
p2605
aVAs shown in Fig.
p2606
aV2A, the p53 level in A549-E6 cells was much lower than that in A549 cells after exposure to 2 or 8 grays of \u03b3-rays.
p2607
aVSimilarly, p21Waf1/Cip1 levels in the A549 and the A549-E6 cells after irradiation showed the same trend as the p53 expression (Fig.
p2608
aV2B).
p2609
aVThese data suggested that the expression of HPV E6 in the A549-E6 clone is sufficient to degrade the p53 level in the transfected A549 cells.
p2610
aVNext, A549 and A549-E6 cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR at different concentrations for 72 h, and then MTT assay was performed to test cell viability in a fashion analogous to the experiments demonstrated in Fig.
p2611
aV1A.
p2612
aVAs shown in Fig.
p2613
aV2C, cell viability in the A549-E6 was much higher than that in the A549 cells after treatment with 5-aza-CdR at different concentrations.
p2614
aVThese results support the hypothesis that cell viability after treatment with 5-aza-CdR is related to wild-type p53 in the A549 cells.
p2615
aVTo investigate the reasons for the difference between A549 and A549-E6 cells, p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was evaluated by Western immunoblot (Fig.
p2616
aV2, D\u2013E).
p2617
aVClearly, both p53 levels as well as p21Waf1/Cip1 levels were significantly increased in A549 cells after treatment with 5-aza-CdR (Fig.
p2618
aV2, D\u2013E).
p2619
aVThis was not seen in the A549-E6 cells, even when they were treated with 5-aza-CdR at higher concentrations (up to 10 \u03bcm; Fig.
p2620
aV2E).
p2621
aVAlthough p21Waf1/Cip1 expression is slightly increased in the A549-E6 cells upon treatment with 5-aza-CdR, the effect is very attenuated when compared with the parental A549 cells (Fig.
p2622
aV2E).
p2623
aVFor further confirmation of the critical role of p53 in the 5-aza-CdR-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression, a full-length p21 promoter construct (pWWP-Luc) that included two p53 binding elements and a truncated p21 promoter (pWP101-Luc) that lacked any p53 binding site (Fig.
p2624
aV3A) were transiently transfected into A549 cells, and relative luciferase activity (RLU) was evaluated after treatment with 5-aza-CdR in both transfectants.
p2625
aVAs shown in Fig.
p2626
aV3B, the RLU in the pWWP-Luc-transfected A549 cells was much higher than that in the pWP101-Luc-transfected A549 cells after treatment with 5-aza-CdR.
p2627
aVThe 5-aza-CdR-induced increase in the RLU was dose-dependent.
p2628
aVThe RLU in pWWP-transfected cells, for example, increased 3-fold when treated with 5-aza-CdR at 5 \u03bcm compared with the same transfectants treated at 0.5 \u03bcm (Fig.
p2629
aV3B).
p2630
aVThe RLU, however, was not significantly increased in the pWP101-transfected A549 cells after 5-aza-CdR treatments (Fig.
p2631
aV3B).
p2632
aVBecause there is no endogenous p53 in H1299 cells, the RLU was not increased in the pWWP-transfected H1299 cells after treatment with 5-aza-CdR (Fig.
p2633
aV3C).
p2634
aVTo determine which p53 binding site of the p21 promoter was important for the 5-aza-CdR treatment, pWWP-Luc containing the mutated first p53 binding site (Mut-1) and second p53 binding site (Mut-2) were constructed (Fig.
p2635
aV3A) and then transfected into A549 cells that were subsequently treated with 5-aza-CdR.
p2636
aVAs shown in Fig.
p2637
aV3D, the RLUs decreased from 3.4 to 1.42 and 1.51, respectively, after 5-aza-CdR treatment when the Mut-1 or Mut-2 transfectants were compared with wild-type pWWP-transfected cells (Fig.
p2638
aV3D).
p2639
aVNo difference in the RLU between the Mut-1 and Mut-2 transfected cells was observed after 5-aza-CdR treatment (Fig.
p2640
aV3D).
p2641
aVThe data suggest that both p53 binding sites in the p21 promoter are important in inducing p21Waf1/Cip1 expression in response to 5-aza-CdR treatment.
p2642
aV5-Aza-CdR Activates the p53/p21 Pathway through DNA Damage\u2014Because 5-aza-CdR is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, it was necessary to rule out the possibility that the p21 promoter is fully or partially methylated in A549 cells.
p2643
aVTo detect the methylation status of the p21 promoter, we performed combined bisulfite restriction analysis and bisulfite sequencing of the p21 promoter from A549 and H1299 cells.
p2644
aVThe combined bisulfite restriction analysis confirmed that the CpG island of the p21 promoter (-233 to +2; Fig.
p2645
aV3A) was unmethylated (Fig.
p2646
aV4).
p2647
aVBisulfite sequencing analysis confirmed these findings (Table I).
p2648
aVTen separate clones were selected for the sequencing.
p2649
aVThe promoter regions of the p21 gene in A549 and H1299 cells were shown to be almost totally unmethylated in the 24 CGs analyzed by bisulfite sequencing (1 of 240 CGs in A549 cells and 3 of 240 CGs in H1299 cells are methylated, respectively; Table I).
p2650
aVTo investigate whether 5-aza-CdR plays a direct role in damaging DNA, comet assay was performed as well.
p2651
aVA549 cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR at 0.1, 1, and 5 \u03bcm for 72 h and then harvested for this assay.
p2652
aVAs shown in Fig.
p2653
aV5, dose-dependent DNA damage was observed after 5-aza-CdR treatment.
p2654
aVCompared with the untreated control (Fig.
p2655
aV5A), 5-aza-CdR even at a low concentration (0.1 \u03bcm) induced DNA damage,
p2656
aVas indicated by the presence of a DNA tail (Fig.
p2657
aV5B).
p2658
aVGreater DNA tail area and longer DNA tail length (a distance from DNA head to the end of DNA tail) show more extensive DNA damage.
p2659
aVThese 5-aza-CdR-induced DNA-damaging features are observed more frequently in the cells treated with a higher concentration of 5-aza-CdR than that with a lower concentration of 5-aza-CdR (Fig.
p2660
aV5, compare C and D with A).
p2661
aVThe quantitative data of 5-aza-CdR-induced DNA damage as determined by comet assay are shown in Table II.
p2662
aVFor example, the percentage of DNA tail area relative to the total area and the DNA tail length are increased 2.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively, when cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR at 0.1 \u03bcm compared with that in the untreated cells (Table II).
p2663
aVSimilarly, in the cells treated with 5-aza-CdR at 5 \u03bcm, the percentage and the length are increased 4.2- and 3.8-fold, respectively (Table II).
p2664
aVThese results suggest that 5-aza-CdR inhibits cell proliferation by damaging DNA, which causes activation of the p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway.
p2665
aVIncreased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 after inhibition of DNA methyltransferase has been reported by several investigators (37\u201339).
p2666
aVTo date, at least two separate mechanisms explain this effect.
p2667
aVThe first mechanism involves a demethylating function.
p2668
aV5-Aza-CdR, for example, was reported to bind to DNMT and inactivate the enzyme (40), inducing a re-expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 in cells that are hypermethylated in the promoter of the p21 gene (30, 41, 42).
p2669
aVA second mechanism for enhanced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression is independent of DNA methylation.
p2670
aVFor instance, a significant increase in p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was observed in human cancer T24 cells following treatment with DNMT antisense oligonucleotides (43) or DNMT antagonist (37) and in normal human fibroblasts with 5-aza-CdR (44), but the promoter region of p21 in these cells is totally unmethylated.
p2671
aVThese data indicate that inhibition of DNMT itself, unrelated to methylation status, may activate p21Waf1/Cip1 expression.
p2672
aVConsistent with these reports, in the present study, the 5-aza-CdR-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression in A549 cells is not associated with DNA methylation because the promoter region of p21 is almost completely unmethylated (Fig.
p2673
aV4 and Table I).
p2674
aVAs one of the principle downstream effectors of p53, p21Waf1/Cip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein and plays a role in preventing cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk2 kinase from promoting cell cycle progression (45).
p2675
aVThe ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase in response to DNA damage is largely dependent on p21Waf1/Cip1 expression (26).
p2676
aVTherefore, the p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway confers the damaged cells enough time to repair DNA and ensure that the cell cycle progresses correctly.
p2677
aVThere is conflicting data as to whether expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 in cells after inhibition of DNMT is dependent on p53 changes.
p2678
aV5-Aza-CdR induced an elevated p53 level in human colon cancer cells, but p21Waf1/Cip1 expression is not completely dependent on p53 status.
p2679
aVIn their experimental system, Karpf et al.
p2680
aV(27) showed that p21Waf1/Cip1 expression induced by 5-aza-CdR was not only observed in human colon tumor cells HCT (p53+/+) but also seen in HCT (p53-/-) cells, although the degree of elevated p21Waf1/Cip1 is different in both cell lines.
p2681
aVMilutinovic also reported that DNMT antagonists or antisense oligonucleotides can induce rapid expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 in A549 cells, but p53 levels are not changed (37).
p2682
aVIn this case, the DNMT antagonist or antisense oligonucleotides are not incorporated into DNA; therefore direct DNA damage with subsequent enhanced p53 expression does not occur.
p2683
aVHowever, in the present study, p21Waf1/Cip1 expression in A549 cells after 5-aza-CdR treatment in limited doses is totally dependent on p53 expression (Fig.
p2684
aV2, D\u2013E).
p2685
aVThis p53-dependent p21Waf1/Cip1 expression is demonstrated by the following evidence: 1) Elevated p21Waf1/Cip1 expression after 5-aza-CdR treatment occurred only in A549 cells (with wild-type p53) but not in H1299 cells (p53-null) (Fig.
p2686
aV1C); 2) 5-aza-CdR-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression in A549 cells is much decreased when p53 levels were diminished by transfection with an HPV E6 gene that promotes p53 degradation (Fig.
p2687
aV2, D\u2013E); and 3) deletion and mutation analysis showed increased relative luciferase activities after 5-aza-CdR treatment in cells with transfected full-length p21 promoter (with intact p53 binding sites) but not in those with a truncated p21 promoter (without p53 binding sites) or full-length p21 promoter (with mutant p53 sites) (Fig.
p2688
aV3, B and D).
p2689
aVTherefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the antineoplastic effect of 5-aza-CdR may activate p53 and subsequently induce an increase in p21Waf1/Cip1 expression through which cell proliferation is inhibited.
p2690
aVIncreases in p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 levels in mammalian cells are often observed when cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents including irradiation (46, 47), UV light (48, 49), and chemicals (50).
p2691
aVUpon exposure to these DNA-damaging elements, p53 is activated, taking part in post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation (26, 51, 52).
p2692
aVPreviously, 5-aza-CdR was reported to be a potential DNA-damaging agent in embryonic cells, and its cytotoxicity was related to DNMT itself and not the secondary demethylation of genomic DNA (15).
p2693
aV5-Aza-CdR was incorporated into DNA, and then the spontaneous degradation of the incorporated analog may result in DNA damage (11, 53).
p2694
aVIt has also been shown that 5-aza-CdR, when incorporated into DNA, covalently links with DNMT, an event that could cause DNA damage because of the structural instability at its incorporation sites (54) or by obstructing DNA synthesis (15, 55).
p2695
aVConsistent with these reports, our data for the first time demonstrates directly that 5-aza-CdR is a DNA-damaging agent when assayed by comet assay (Fig.
p2696
aV5 and Table II).
p2697
aVInterestingly, growth inhibition and cytotoxicity induced by 5-aza-CdR at higher doses (&gt;20 \u03bcm) are not dependent on p53 status because the cells tested are mostly dead after 5-aza-CdR treatment (data not shown).
p2698
aVThis p53-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation by a limited dose of 5-aza-CdR treatment has a great potential advantage in the treatment of different human cancers.
p2699
aVThe major reported side effect of 5-aza-CdR when pushed to the maximum tolerated dose is hematopoietic toxicity (10).
p2700
aVA more limited dose of 5-aza-CdR treatment may decrease these toxic effects on normal tissue and cells.
p2701
aVIn addition, the limited dose of 5-aza-CdR required to induce effects in wild-type p53 cells may explain why different human cancer cells appear to have different sensitivities to 5-aza-CdR treatment.
p2702
aVp53 status may be a critical factor for judging the antineoplastic effects of 5-aza-CdR in cancer cells.
p2703
aVAlthough there is insufficient data to show a relationship between p53 status and efficacy of 5-aza-CdR in patients,
p2704
aVseveral studies suggest that p53 status may be a key predictive factor for the efficacy of 5-aza-CdR treatments (10, 24, 56).
p2705
aVFor example, 5-aza-CdR appears to be very effective in the treatment of adult human chronic myelogenous leukemias, which generally have wild-type p53 (56, 57) but is less demonstrably effective in the treatment of solid tumors, such as human lung cancers, which typically have mutant p53 (24, 58).
p2706
aVOur data suggest that the future clinical development of 5-aza-CdR may depend on genetic factors such as the p53 status of the treated tumor.

aV1,3-Butadiene (BD) is a confirmed rodent carcinogen and a suspect human carcinogen that forms mutagenic epoxide metabolites during biotransformation.
p2708
aVSpecies differences in the roles of individual DNA reactive intermediates in BD mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not completely understood.
p2709
aVEvidence suggests that 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) is responsible for the mutagenic effect induced by exposures to low concentrations of BD in mice and that metabolites of 3-butene-1,2-diol (BD-diol) are involved in the mutagenicity at high exposures in both mice and rats.
p2710
aVTwo reactive metabolites, 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (EB-diol) and hydroxymethylvinyl ketone (HMVK), are formed during the biotransformation of BD-diol and could potentially be involved in BD-diol associated mutagenicity.
p2711
aVTo examine the role of EB-diol in BD-diol mutagenicity we have evaluated the dosimetry of N7-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)guanine (THB-Gua) and N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine (THB-Val) in female B6C3F1 mice and female F344 rats exposed by inhalation to 0, 6, 18 and 36 p.p.m.

p2717
aVMost importantly, the shape of the dose\u2013response curve for THB adduct formation mimicked the one observed for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) mutation frequency.
p2718
aVThis showed that THB adducts, which are not thought to be responsible for causing the mutations, are good quantitative indicators of mutagenicity in rodents exposed to BD-diol.
p2719
aVAlthough the potential contribution of HMVK still needs to be evaluated, the data suggest that EB-diol is responsible, at least in part, for BD-diol associated mutagenicity in rodents.

aVThe National Toxicology Program classifies BD as a known human carcinogen (8), the International Agency for the Research of Cancer classifies BD as a probable human carcinogen (9) and BD is classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as carcinogenic to humans by inhalation (10).
p2726
aVBD biotransformation is complex and involves several pathways.
p2727
aVOf particular interest in the current study is the 3-butene-1,2-diol (BD-diol) metabolic pathway (Scheme 1).
p2728
aVBD is initially metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) to 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB) (11\u201313).
p2729
aVBD-diol is then formed by the subsequent hydrolysis of EB by epoxide hydrolase (EH) (11\u201314).
p2730
aVBD-diol is metabolized by CYP450 to form hydroxymethylvinyl ketone (HMVK) (15) or 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (EB-diol) (11,13,16).
p2731
aVBD-diol can also be metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to 2-hydroxy-3-butenal (HBAL), which may spontaneously rearrange to form HMVK (17).
p2732
aVHMVK reacts with glutathione via glutathione-S-transferase (GST) to eventually form mercapturic acids (18\u201322) including 1,2-dihydroxy-4-(N-acetylcysteinyl)butane (MI), the primary mercapturic acid metabolite found in the urine of humans exposed to BD (19).
p2733
aVSeveral reactive intermediates are formed during BD metabolism.
p2734
aVAlthough DEB, EB and EB-diol are known mutagens (23,24), the role of these epoxides in BD mutagenesis and carcinogenesis is not fully understood.
p2735
aVBy evaluating the induction of Hprt mutations in rodents exposed to relevant concentrations of BD, EB, DEB and BD-diol, Walker et al.
p2736
aV(25) proposed that DEB is responsible for mutagenicity in mice exposed to low levels of BD, while metabolites of BD-diol play a significant role in the mutagenic response in mice and rats exposed to higher concentrations of BD.
p2737
aVEB is not thought to play a major role in mutagenicity in either species (25,26).
p2738
aVIn addition to being implicated in the mutagenicity of BD, the BD-diol pathway is important for several reasons.
p2739
aVFirst, exposure to BD-diol via inhalation causes an increase in Hprt mutation frequency in both mice and rats (25).
p2740
aVSecond, intraperitoneal administration of a high dose of BD-diol is hepatotoxic in rats (27).
p2741
aVThird, BD-diol is a precursor to MI, an important urinary metabolite in humans exposed to BD (19).
p2742
aVFourth, BD-diol is a major metabolite of BD in single-pass liver perfusion experiments conducted in both mice and rats (28) and is present in the urine of rodents exposed to BD (25,29).
p2743
aVFinally, as previously shown, the metabolism of BD-diol yields two reactive compounds.

aVEB-diol is a known mutagen (23,24), while HMVK is expected to be mutagenic based on comparisons with other \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyls (30) and because it reacts with DNA in vitro to form potentially promutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts (31).
p2745
aVThe primary goal of the current study was to characterize the dose\u2013response relationships between direct exposures of mice and rats to BD-diol and the formation of an N7-guanine DNA adduct and an N-terminal valine adduct of hemoglobin derived from the in vivo conversion of BD-diol to EB-diol.
p2746
aVThis objective was accomplished by quantifying N7-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)guanine (THB-Gua; Figure 1a) and N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine (THB-Val; Figure 1b) in female B6C3F1 mice and female F344 rats exposed via inhalation to 0, 6, 18 and 36 p.p.m.

aVIn this fashion, we evaluated tissue and species-specific differences in DNA adduct formation in liver (a major site of metabolism) and lung (a target organ for BD-induced cancer in the mouse) of BD-diol exposed mice and rats.
p2749
aVSpecies differences were also evaluated for hemoglobin adducts.
p2750
aVIn addition, DNA and hemoglobin adduct formation were compared with the Hprt mutant frequency data for concurrently exposed rodents to understand the role of EB-diol in mutagenicity occurring via the BD-diol pathway.

p2871
aVWhen comparing the THB-adduct formation between species in the current study, we showed that mice exposed to BD-diol form greater amounts of both THB-Gua and THB-Val than rats.
p2872
aVThis species difference agrees with the existing data showing that mice form greater amounts of EB-diol derived DNA and hemoglobin adducts than rats exposed to a range of BD from 1 to 1250 p.p.m.
p2873
aV(37\u201342).
p2874
aVThe differences in THB adduct formation between mice and rats reflect species differences observed in the metabolism and toxic effects of BD.
p2875
aVSeveral studies have demonstrated that mice have higher levels of BD metabolites than rats in tissues (43,44) and blood (43,45) following in vivo exposure to BD, as well as in perfusate following single-pass liver perfusion experiments (28).
p2876
aVHprt mutant frequencies in splenic T-cells of mice were consistently greater than those observed in rats concurrently exposed to BD (46), EB (47) and BD-diol (25) and, as previously mentioned, the mouse is the most sensitive species in carcinogenicity studies (2).
p2877
aVAn evaluation of THB-Gua adducts showed virtually no differences between liver and lung for either species.
p2878
aVKoc et al.
p2879
aV(37) also observed similar THB-Gua levels in liver, lung as well as kidney from both rats and mice exposed to 20, 62.5 and 625 p.p.m.
p2880
aVBD.
p2881
aVWhile THB-Gua levels in these tissues appear comparable, adduct levels in testis may be different.
p2882
aVBooth et al.
p2883
aV(39) showed that liver and lung have similar levels of THB-Gua, but the testis had lower levels in mice and rats exposed to 1, 5 or 20 p.p.m.
p2884
aVBD.
p2885
aVOn the other hand, mice exposed to 200 p.p.m.
p2886
aVBD had similar levels of THB-Gua in liver, lung and testis (38).
p2887
aVThe differences between THB-Gua adduct levels in testis and the other tissues may be owing to the variations in DNA repair capacity at different BD exposure levels.
p2888
aVThe activity of alkyladenine glycosylase (Aag), an enzyme involved in repairing N7-methylguanine adducts in mice (48), is similar in liver, lung, and kidney but much higher in testis of male Aag+/+ mice (49).
p2889
aVThis finding suggests that the testis has a greater ability to remove adducts via base excision repair at exposure levels that are unlikely to saturate DNA repair.
p2890
aVSince the results in our study show identical levels of THB-Gua between tissues with similar repair capabilities, it appears EB-diol is stable enough to circulate rapidly and evenly throughout the body as has been previously proposed (37).
p2891
aVThe shape of the dose\u2013response curves for THB-Gua and THB-Val are also noteworthy.
p2892
aVAlthough no DNA adduct data for mice exposed to 36 p.p.m.
p2893
aVBD-diol is available, the increase in THB adduct levels was similar when the BD-diol exposure increased from 6 to 18 p.p.m.
p2894
aVTHB-Gua in liver increased by 2.1-fold and THB-Val by 2.4-fold.
p2895
aVBecause of the extended dose\u2013response data in the rat, the similarities in THB adduct formation are even more evident.
p2896
aVThe amount of adduct increased 2.1-fold for THB-Gua in liver and 2.5-fold for THB-Val when the exposure concentration was increased from 6 to 18 p.p.m.

p2901
aVBD-diol, indicative of metabolic saturation for EB-diol formation.
p2902
aVThis is not surprising since BD-diol clearance in female mice exposed to BD-diol is supralinear (25), which also indicates metabolic saturation.

aVWe do not have dose\u2013response data for THB-Gua formation in mouse.
p2916
aVAt lower concentrations our hemoglobin data were also consistent with the published results showing THB-Val formation did not reach saturation in male B6C3F1 mice and male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats following 2 weeks of exposure to concentrations up to 20 p.p.m.

aVBD-diol.
p2922
aVDirect comparisons between BD and BD-diol are complicated, however, by the presence of different P450 substrates and their potential effects on metabolism.
p2923
aVOf great interest are the similar shaped dose\u2013response curves observed for THB adduct formation and the induction of Hprt mutant frequency in splenic T-cells from mice (Figure 8a) and rats (Figures 8b and 9) exposed to BD-diol.
p2924
aVThese similarities suggest that THB adducts are good quantitative indicators of EB-diol formation and its resulting splenic T-cell mutagenicity at the Hprt locus in rodents exposed to BD-diol.
p2925
aVA similar conclusion was given by Meng et al.
p2926
aV(52) who found that THB-Gua formation correlated with Hprt mutation frequency in rodents exposed to 0, 6.25, 62.5 and 625 p.p.m.
p2927
aVBD.
p2928
aVBased on both the current study and the previous work, it appears that EB-diol plays a significant role in BD-diol and BD associated mutagenicity.
p2929
aVIt is not likely that THB-Gua is actually causing the Hprt mutations since N-7 alkylguanine adducts are not promutagenic.
p2930
aVOther minor promutagenic THB adducts may, however, be responsible.
p2931
aVIn summary, this is the first description of THB adduct dosimetry in rodents exposed to BD-diol.

aVThe data agree with the species differences observed in BD metabolism, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.
p2933
aVMore importantly, our data show that THB adducts arising from EB-diol may be good quantitative indicators of mutagenicity.
p2934
aVWhile our results suggest that EB-diol contributes to BD-diol associated mutagenicity, it remains necessary to determine the contributions made by HMVK.
p2935
aVSprague and Elfarra (22) showed that as the dose was increased the percentage of BD-diol metabolized to HMVK-derived mercapturic acid decreased.
p2936
aVThe authors interpret this as an indication of metabolic saturation.
p2937
aVHowever, the formation of HMVK-derived mercapturic acid metabolites appears to be approximately linear up to doses of 1420 \u03bcmol/kg or 125 mg/kg, in male B6C3F1 mice and male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats.
p2938
aVFollowing intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg BD-diol, a plasma concentration &gt;100 \u03bcg BD-diol/ml in male B6C3F1 mice was observed (16) while inhalation of 36 p.p.m.
p2939
aVBD-diol for 6 h, the highest concentration used in our current study, produced a plasma concentration of \u223c2.5 \u03bcg BD-diol/ml in female B6C3F1 mice.
p2940
aVTherefore, it appears as if HMVK formation, indicated by HMVK-derived mercapturic acid formation, is linear at plasma BD-diol concentrations more than 40× greater than that evaluated in the current study.
p2941
aVBecause Walker et al.
p2942
aV(25) observed a plateau in the induction of Hprt mutations at concentrations considerably lower than where HMVK saturation would occur,
p2943
aVit is unlikely that HMVK is as important as EB-diol in BD-diol associated mutagenicity.
p2944
aVHowever, empirical evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis.
p2945
aVWhile the potential mutagenicity of HMVK is yet to be determined, it is likely that EB-diol is responsible, at least in part, for the mutagenicity associated with BD-diol.
p2946
aVDNA damage caused by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) or other polynuclear hydrocarbons (PAHs) induce p53 protein as a protective measure to eliminate the possibility of mutagenic fixation of the DNA damage.
p2947
aV12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) inhibits p53 response induced by B[a]P and other DNA-damaging agents and may cause tumor promotion.
p2948
aVThe molecular mechanism of attenuation of B[a]P-induced p53 response by TPA is not known.
p2949
aVWe investigated the effect of TPA on p53 response in (±)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)-treated mouse epidermal JB6(P+) Cl 41 cells.
p2950
aVBPDE treatment induced p53 accumulation which was attenuated significantly by TPA.
p2951
aVCells treated with BPDE and TPA showed increased ratio of Mdm2 to p53 proteins in p53 immunoprecipitate and decreased p53 life span compared to BPDE-treated cells indicating p53 destabilization by TPA.
p2952
aVTPA also inhibited BPDE-induced p53 phosphorylation at serine15.
p2953
aVActivation of both ERKs and p38 MAPK by BPDE and attenuation of BPDE-induced p53 accumulation by U0126 or SB202190, specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 or p38 MAPK, indicate the role of ERKs and p38 MAPK in p53 accumulation.
p2954
aVInterestingly, TPA potentiated BPDE-induced activation of ERKs whereas p38 MAPK activation was significantly inhibited by TPA, suggesting that inhibition of p38 MAPK is involved in p53 attenuation by TPA.
p2955
aVFurthermore, SB202190 treatment caused decreased p53 stability and inhibition of phosphorylation of p53 at serine15 in BPDE-treated cells.
p2956
aVWe also observed that TPA or SB202190 attenuated BPDE-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) activation in JB6 Cl 41 cells harboring NF\u03baB reporter plasmid.
p2957
aVTo our knowledge this is the first report that TPA inhibits chemical carcinogen-induced NF\u03baB activation.
p2958
aVInterference of TPA with BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation implicates abrogation of p53 function which has been discussed.
p2959
aVOverall, our data suggest that abrogation of BPDE-induced p53 response and of NF\u03baB activation by TPA is mediated by impairment of the signaling pathway involving p38 MAPK.
p2960
aVMany polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) are well-known carcinogens and a considerable amount of data supports the role of these compounds in the induction of carcinogenesis (1,2).
p2961
aVThe cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase system metabolically activates B[a]P preferentially to (+)-anti-B[a]P-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide [(+)-anti-BPDE)], a reactive electrophile which binds to cellular DNA predominantly at the N2 position of deoxyguanosine (dG) and is implicated as the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of B[a]P (3).
p2962
aVAlthough B[a]P possesses carcinogenic potential, the tumorigenicity of B[a]P is greatly enhanced by the presence of tumor promoters (4,5).
p2963
aVThere is increasing evidence that DNA damage caused by B[a]P or other PAHs induces p53 levels in a number of animal or cell systems (6\u20139).
p2964
aVInhibition of p53 induction following DNA damage interferes with p53-mediated protective functions, which may lead to carcinogenesis.
p2965
aVAttenuation of DNA damage-induced p53 response by tumor promoters involves two fundamental events including inhibition of p53 accumulation and activation.
p2966
aVIt is observed that DNA damage-induced p53 accumulation is due mainly to an increase in p53 protein stability rather than to an increase in steady-state p53 mRNA levels (10,11).
p2967
aVStability and activation of p53 protein are mainly regulated by its interaction with mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) oncoprotein and post-translational modifications (12\u201316).
p2968
aVIn normal, non-stressed cells, p53 has a short half-life of 15\u201320 min (17) and is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (18,19).
p2969
aVThe key mediator of p53 protein stability, Mdm2 protein, binds to the transactivation domain of p53 (amino acids 20\u201340) and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting p53 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (12,13).
p2970
aVThe interaction of p53 with Mdm2 depends on the phosphorylation status of both p53 and Mdm2 proteins (20,21).
p2971
aVp53 is known to be phosphorylated in vitro or in vivo by several kinases e.g.
p2972
aVATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, DNA-PK at several sites within its N- and C-terminal domains (14\u201316).
p2973
aVMany of these kinase-mediated modifications are inducible upon DNA damage.
p2974
aVAmongst the multiple modification sites on p53 molecule, it is observed that phosphorylations at Ser15 and Ser20 play an important role in p53 accumulation and function (20\u201323).
p2975
aVIt is also observed among other protein kinases that have been shown to phosphorylate p53 include mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (24\u201327).
p2976
aVDNA damage is known to activate the MAPK pathway (28,29) and the dysregulation of MAPK signaling in human cancer is well documented (30).
p2977
aVStabilization and activation of p53 in response to DNA damage are known to be mediated by extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) 1 or 2 (24\u201326,31) and p38 MAPK (26\u201328,32), which phosphorylate p53 at several sites.
p2978
aVThe biological significance of stabilization/activation of p53 through kinase-mediated phosphorylation relates to the transcriptional activating function of p53 which elicits cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (33).
p2979
aVIt is well known that p53-dependent cell cycle arrest requires transactivation of p21Waf1, which inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) (34).
p2980
aVAs candidates to mediate p53-dependent apoptosis, several p53 target genes including Bax and PIG genes have been suggested (35,36).
p2981
aVRecently it has been observed that the induction of p53 causes activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) that correlates with the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (37).
p2982
aVInhibition or loss of NF\u03baB activity abrogated p53-induced apoptosis, indicating that NF\u03baB is essential in p53-mediated cell death.
p2983
aVAbrogation of DNA damage-induced p53 stabilization/activation associated with the loss of p53 function may lead to tumor promotion.
p2984
aVTPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and other tumor promoters are known to inhibit p53 induction in vivo in mouse skin and in vitro in other mammalian cells in response to DNA-damage caused by B[a]P or other DNA damaging agents (38\u201342).
p2985
aVOn the contrary, it was observed that the tumor promoter phorbol ester alone induced p53 transcriptional activity and activation of NF\u03baB (43\u201346).
p2986
aVAlthough treatment of cells individually with either B[a]P or TPA causes activation of p53, the attenuating effect of TPA on BPDE-induced p53 response both in vitro and in vivo is very interesting.
p2987
aVThe mechanism of attenuation of B[a]P-induced p53 response by TPA or other tumor promoters has not been studied.
p2988
aVIn this study, we investigated the mechanism of attenuation of (±)-anti-benzo[a]pyvene-7,8-diol-9(BPDE)-induced p53 response by TPA in promotion-sensitive JB6 mouse epidermal cells (Cl 41) which are widely used for studies of the role of signal transduction pathways in tumor promotion (47\u201350).
p2989
aVHere we demonstrate that attenuation of BPDE-induced p53 response by TPA is associated with a decrease in p53 stability and increased binding of Mdm2 with p53, and that TPA mediates this effect by interfering with p38 MAPK not ERKs, with concomitant inhibition of p53 phosphorylation at serine15 residue.
p2990
aVWe also showed that TPA severely interferes with BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation, a downstream target of p53 implicated in the apoptotic function of p53, and that p38 MAPK may have a role in this regard.
p2991
aVTo our knowledge this is the first report that TPA, a tumor promoter, inhibits chemical carcinogen-induced NF\u03baB activation.

aVDegradation of p53 is facilitated by binding of Mdm2 to p53 at the N-terminus (amino acids 19\u201326) (12,13).
p3033
aVIn order to assess the effect of BPDE on p53 and p53-bound Mdm2 protein levels, Cl 41 cells were treated with BPDE and the level of p53 in the cell extract was determined by western immunobloting (Figure 1A).
p3034
aVThe level of p53-bound Mdm2 protein was determined by co-immunoprecipitation with p53 antibody followed by western blotting of the immunoprecipitate using the respective antibodies (Figure 1B).
p3035
aVA dose-dependent (0\u20131.0 \u03bcM) increase in the induction of p53 protein with BPDE was observed (Figure 1A, lanes 1, 2 and 4\u20136).
p3036
aVThe p53-bound Mdm2 protein level also increased in cells treated with 1.0 \u03bcM BPDE compared with untreated cells (Figure 1B, lane 2).
p3037
aVWe examined whether TPA interferes with the BPDE-induced p53 accumulation which may abrogate p53-mediated protective functions in response to DNA damage.
p3038
aVBPDE-induced p53 accumulation was significantly inhibited (63% inhibition) by TPA treatment (Figure 1A, lane 3).
p3039
aVA significantly higher ratio of Mdm2 to p53 proteins (3.2\u20131.0) in p53 immunoprecipitate from cells treated with BPDE and TPA compared with the ratio in the p53 immunoprecipitate from cells treated with BPDE alone (0.92\u20131.0) was observed (Figure 1B).
p3040
aVAlpha Inotech software was used to quantify the protein band density in all western experiments.
p3041
aVThe Mdm2 protein level is under complex regulation in stressed cells.
p3042
aVp53 protein which trans-activates Mdm2 gene is also known to be downregulated at protein level by Mdm2 through Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation (12,13).
p3043
aVWe observed that the downregulation of BPDE-induced p53 accumulation by TPA is not associated with downregulation of the p53-bound Mdm2 protein level; rather an increased ratio of Mdm2 to p53 protein was observed in TPA treated cells.
p3044
aVThe data possibly indicate that TPA inhibits BPDE-induced p53 accumulation by promoting Mdm2-mediated destabilization of p53.
p3045
aVWe studied the effect of TPA on p53 stability in BPDE-treated Cl 41 cells.
p3046
aVThe lifetime (stability) of p53 is determined according to the procedure described before (52).
p3047
aVCells were treated either with BPDE and then with TPA or with BPDE alone.
p3048
aVBefore harvesting cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor) was added in the medium and the cells were harvested at different time points (0\u20131 h) and analyzed for the p53 protein levels by western immunoblotting (Figure 2).
p3049
aVCells treated with BPDE followed by TPA had significantly less proportion of p53 protein remaining 1 h after cycloheximide treatment (9.3% remaining) compared with cells treated with BPDE alone (57% remaining) (Figure 2, panels B and A).
p3050
aVThe data suggest that TPA downregulates p53 protein by decreasing its stability.
p3051
aVTPA inhibits p38 MAPK and p38 MAPK-inhibition attenuates BPDE-induced p53 accumulation, stabilization and phosphorylation.
p3052
aVDownregulation of BPDE-induced p53 accumulation by TPA prompted us to examine the involvement of the signaling pathway(s) which mediates the effect of TPA.
p3053
aVWe observed that cells treated with U0126, a specific inhibitor of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK or MAPKK) or SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK caused attenuation of BPDE-induced p53 accumulation (Figure 3A).
p3054
aVSB202190 (2 \u03bcM) and U0126 (10 \u03bcM) caused 60% and 40% attenuation of BPDE-induced p53 accumulation, respectively.
p3055
aVWe further examined whether BPDE induces activation of ERKs and p38 MAPK, and whether TPA has an effect on the activation of ERKs and p38 MAPK in BPDE-treated cells.
p3056
aVBPDE-treated cells showed increased level of phosphorylation of both the ERKs and p38 MAPK which corresponds with the increased activation of both kinases as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of their substrates Elk-1 and ATF-2, respectively (Figure 3B).
p3057
aVInterestingly, TPA treatment caused potentiation of BPDE-induced phosphorylation and activation of ERKs whereas BPDE-induced phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK were significantly downregulated by TPA (Figure 3B).
p3058
aVIt is also observed that cells treated with U0126 (10 \u03bcM) and SB202190 (2 \u03bcM) at concentrations which inhibited p53 accumulation also inhibited BPDE-induced phosphorylation and activation of ERKs and p38 MAPK, respectively.
p3059
aVThese results indicate that although p53 accumulation (possibly stabilization) in response to BPDE involves activation of ERKs and p38 MAPK, TPA attenuates BPDE-induced p53 accumulation by interfering with p38 MAPK and not with ERKs.
p3060
aVWe also observed that p53 stability is reduced to a greater extent in cells treated with BPDE and SB202190 (Figure 3C; lower panel) compared with cells treated with BPDE alone (Figure 3C; upper panel).
p3061
aVBPDE-treated cells show a much higher level of p53 1 h after cycloheximide treatment (57% remaining) compared with the cells treated with BPDE and SB202190 (15% remaining).
p3062
aVPost-translational modifications of p53 regulate its stability and activation (14\u201316).
p3063
aVDNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15/20 is important for p53 stability and activity (20\u201323).
p3064
aVWe further investigated whether BPDE-induced p53 accumulation is associated with the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15/20 residues and whether TPA treatment or inhibition of p38 MAPK has any effect on p53 phosphorylation in BPDE-treated cells.
p3065
aVWe determined phspho-(Ser15/20) p53 levels in extracts of treated and untreated cells using phspho-(Ser15/20) p53-specific antibodies and observed that BPDE upregulated Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 (Figure 3D) but not Ser20 phosphorylation (data not shown).
p3066
aVTPA or SB202190 caused significant inhibition of BPDE-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 residue (Figure 3D).
p3067
aVNext, we examined whether p53 accumulation and phosphorylation are also induced by proteasomal inhibitor N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN) (Calbiochem) in order to compare with BPDE-induced p53 accumulation and phosphorylation, and whether TPA can attenuate ALLN-induced p53 accumulation and phosphorylation, if they occurred.
p3068
aVTreatment
p3069
aVAND
p3070
aVof cells with 30 \u03bcM ALLN for 16 h induced p53 accumulation but not p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and, interestingly, TPA did not attenuate ALLN-induced p53 accumulation (Figure 3E).
p3071
aVThese results suggest that proteasome inhibition-mediated p53 stabilization is different from BPDE-induced p53 stabilization with respect to p53 phosphorylation and inability of TPA to attenuate ALLN-induced p53 accumulation may have implication that p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 has possibly a role in BPDE-induced p53 stabilization which is interfered by TPA.
p3072
aVTaken together the above results suggest a possible role of p38 MAPK acting upstream of p53 in a signal transduction pathway initiated by BPDE, and that TPA interferes with this pathway by inhibiting p38 MAPK activity.
p3073
aVDNA damage-induced p53 response triggers a variety of signaling pathways to elicit protective events like apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (33).
p3074
aVSince we observed that TPA attenuates p53 response to BPDE, we further investigated which signaling event(s) downstream of p53 is (are) affected by TPA.
p3075
aVp53-dependent cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage is mediated by p21WAF1 which is a transactivation product of p53 tumor suppressor protein.
p3076
aVWe did not observe any effect of TPA on p21WAF1 expression in cells treated with BPDE (data not shown).
p3077
aVp53-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF\u03baB is involved in the induction of apoptosis (37).
p3078
aVSince NF\u03baB has an important role in the p53-mediated apoptotic signaling event and our data showed that TPA abrogates BPDE-induced p53 response, we were interested in examining whether TPA interferes with NF\u03baB signaling in cells treated with BPDE.
p3079
aVNF\u03baB activation was determined by NF\u03baB-responsive luciferase reporter assay as described in Materials and methods.
p3080
aVBPDE treatment of Cl 41 reporter cells showed a dose- and time-dependent induction of NF\u03baB activity (Figure 4A and B).
p3081
aVUp to 4 h after BPDE treatment, no significant increase in NF\u03baB activity was observed followed by a gradual increase in NF\u03baB activity with time, reaching the maximum at 16 h (53-fold induction) and remaining at this level up to 24 h (Figure 4A).
p3082
aVGradual increase of NF\u03baB activity was also observed with increasing doses of BPDE treatment (Figure 4B).
p3083
aVCells treated with TPA alone also showed increased NF\u03baB activity (3-fold) (Figure 4C).
p3084
aVMost interestingly, TPA caused a marked inhibition (72%) of BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activity instead of the additive activation expected for the combined action of TPA and BPDE (Figure 4C).
p3085
aVTo our knowledge this is the first report that TPA being a tumor promoter inhibits NF\u03baB activation in chemical carcinogen-damaged cells.
p3086
aVSince it is observed that TPA inhibits BPDE-induced p38 MAPK activation, we examined whether inhibition of p38 MAPK has an effect on BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation.
p3087
aVIt is observed that SB202190 treatment caused dose-dependent inhibition of BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation (Figure 4C).
p3088
aVTreatment of cells with 1 and 2 \u03bcM SB202190 caused 22 and 48% inhibition of BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation, respectively.
p3089
aVThese results indicate that downregulation of BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation by TPA is mediated in part by inhibition of p38 MAPK.
p3090
aVIn this investigation, we examined the effect of TPA on BPDE-induced p53 response in mouse epidermal cells (JB6 Cl 41) in order to obtain an insight into the mechanism by which TPA, an established tumor promoter, exerts its tumor promoting effect.
p3091
aVThe promotion-sensitive JB6 Cl 41 cells represent a suitable cellular model to study the tumor promoting activity of various compounds (51).
p3092
aVp53 protein plays a pivotal role as a protective agent in cellular response to various types of genomic damage including chemical carcinogens.
p3093
aVSo, any interference with DNA damage-induced p53 response will be detrimental to normal cellular function and may lead to tumorogenesis.
p3094
aVA previous study demonstrated that TPA caused downregulation of B[a]P-induced p53 accumulation in mouse skin (39).
p3095
aVOur present study confirms this finding in the cell culture system indicating that BPDE induces p53 accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in Cl 41 cells and that TPA significantly attenuates BPDE-induced p53 response.
p3096
aVThe mechanism of attenuation of p53 response by TPA has not been studied.
p3097
aVUnderstanding the mechanism(s) by which TPA interferes with the cellular protective response to DNA damage will help gain an insight into the mechanism of tumor promotion and thus develop therapeutic strategy to prevent cancer.
p3098
aVOur data indicate that destabilization of BPDE-induced p53 at protein level is one of the mechanisms by which TPA attenuates p53 accumulation in response to BPDE.
p3099
aVSince Mdm2 binding to p53 protein triggers ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of p53 (12,13),
p3100
aVour finding of an increased binding of the oncoprotein Mdm2 with p53 in cells treated with BPDE followed by TPA compared with the cells treated with BPDE alone possibly indicates an increased degradation of p53 protein resulting in the attenuation of p53 stability by TPA.
p3101
aVStabilization of p53 protein which is negatively regulated by Mdm2 protein and activation of p53 responsible for its downstream functions are under complex regulation in cells under stress.
p3102
aVThe most important of these regulatory events is the post-translational modification by phosphorylation at specific sites.
p3103
aVPhosphorylation of p53 at serine15 and 20 located at trans-activation domain is critical for stability and activation of p53 (20\u201323).
p3104
aVIt has been demonstrated that mutation of either serine15 or serine20 to alanine prevents the full stabilization and activation of p53 (20,22,23).
p3105
aVRecent studies have proposed that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and/or Ser20 attenuates p53\u2013Mdm2 interaction (20,21).
p3106
aVWe observed that BPDE treatment caused phosphorylation of p53 at serine15 residue but not at serine20 and that TPA inhibits BPDE-induced phosphorylation at serine15 of p53.
p3107
aVThis suggests that attenuation of p53 accumulation and inhibition of p53 phosphorylation at serine15 are two events associated with TPA effect on cells damaged by BPDE.
p3108
aVTo understand the regulation of these two events, it is important to identify the kinase(s) which is the upstream regulator of both the BPDE-induced stabilization and phosphorylation of p53.
p3109
aVOur observation of significant attenuation of BPDE-induced p53 accumulation in cells treated with U0126 (MEK inhibitor) or SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) indicates the possible role of ERKs and p38 MAPK in p53 accumulation.
p3110
aVIt has been observed previously that ERKs and p38 MAPK have roles in stabilization and activation of p53 though phosphorylation at several sites (24\u201328,31,32).
p3111
aVInterestingly, our results show that treatment of cells with TPA downregulates BPDE-induced p38 activation whereas ERK activation is potentiated significantly suggesting that inhibition of p38 kinase activity mediates the effect of TPA on cellular p53 response to BPDE.
p3112
aVThis inference is supported by further observation that SB202190 attenuates not only p53 accumulation but also both the p53 stability and p53 phosphorylation at serine15 in BPDE-treated cells.
p3113
aVThe question remains regarding the possible mechanism of upregulation of ERKs and downregulation of p38 MAPK by TPA in BPDE-treated cells.
p3114
aVTPA is an established protein kinase C (PKC) activator and the involvement of PKC in phosphorylation and activation of Raf, MEK and ERKs is well documented (46,53).
p3115
aVPKC\u03b1 is also known to activate MAP kinases including p38 MAPK (54).
p3116
aVIn agreement with these reports, our observation of upregulation of ERKs by TPA possibly indicates a role of PKC.
p3117
aVBut downregulation of p38 MAPK by TPA in BPDE-treated cells observed by us can not be explained by PKC's involvement as observed by others (54).
p3118
aVInhibitory effect of TPA on p53 accumulation, stability and phosphorylation (serine15) indicates abrogation of p53 function.
p3119
aVOne of the important functions of tumor suppressor p53 is the activation of apoptotic signaling pathway (33,37).
p3120
aVInduction of DNA damage-induced apoptotic signaling pathway in Cl 41cells is associated with p53 phosphorylation at serine15 (27,55).
p3121
aVRegarding the involvement of signaling molecules which mediate the downstream apoptotic function of active p53, it has been reported that induction of p53 causes activation of NF\u03baB that correlates with the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (37).
p3122
aVWe observed that BPDE treatment induced NF\u03baB activity several-fold and that TPA treatment caused significant inhibition of BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation.
p3123
aVTo our knowledge, this is the first report that the tumor promoter TPA downregulates NF\u03baB activation in response to chemical carcinogen-induced DNA damage.
p3124
aVThe question arises regarding the significance of downregulation of NF\u03baB activity with respect to the tumor-promoting function of TPA.
p3125
aVIt is known that NF\u03baB has dual roles towards the apoptotic function.
p3126
aVIt is a transcription factor that can protect or contribute to apoptosis (56).
p3127
aVAlthough the mechanisms underlying the dual nature of NF\u03baB function is not well understood it is suggested that the p53-independent apoptotic activity of E2F-1 is associated with the inhibition of NF\u03baB activation by death receptors such as the TNFR (57), whereas p53-dependent apoptosis is associated with NF\u03baB activation (37).
p3128
aVOur observation of the inhibitory effect of TPA on BPDE-induced p53 response and NF\u03baB activation possibly indicates the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA in BPDE-damaged cells, which may eventually lead to the acquisition of tumorogenic potential by initiated cells.
p3129
aVPrevious investigators reported that activation of ERKs and p38 MAPK is involved in the regulation of NF\u03baB activation (37,58,59).
p3130
aVOur findings indicate that TPA inhibits BPDE-induced NF\u03baB activation by interfering with activation of p38 MAPK and not ERKs.
p3131
aVOverall our data suggest that abrogation of chemical carcinogen-induced p53 response and of NF\u03baB activation by TPA is mediated by impairment of the signaling pathway involving p38 MAPK.

aVTamoxifen is a non-steroidal anti-estrogen used for the treatment of breast cancer and, more recently, as a chemopreventive agent in healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer.
p3133
aVOn the other hand, tamoxifen is a potent hepatocarcinogen in rats, with both tumor-initiating and tumor-promoting properties.
p3134
aVThere is substantial evidence that hepatic tumors in rats are initiated as a result of formation of tamoxifen\u2013DNA adducts; however, events subsequent to DNA adduct formation are not clear.
p3135
aVRecently, it has been demonstrated that genotoxic carcinogens, in addition to exerting genotoxic effects, often cause epigenetic alterations.
p3136
aVIn the current study, we investigated whether or not the mechanism of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis includes both genotoxic and epigenetic components.
p3137
aVFemale Fisher 344 rats were fed a 420 p.p.m.
p3138
aVtamoxifen diet for 6, 12, 18 or 24 weeks.
p3139
aVHepatic tamoxifen\u2013DNA adduct levels, as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, were 580 adducts/108 nt at 6 weeks, and increased to \u223c1700 adducts/108 nt by 18 weeks.
p3140
aVGlobal liver DNA hypomethylation, as determined by an HpaII-based cytosine extension assay, was increased at all time points, with the maximum increase (\u223c200%) occurring at 6 weeks.
p3141
aVProtein expressions of maintenance (DNMT1) DNA methyltransferase and de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b were decreased at all time points.
p3142
aVLikewise, trimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 was significantly decreased at all time points.
p3143
aVIn contrast, non-target tissues (i.e.
p3144
aVmammary gland, pancreas and spleen) did not show any changes in global DNA methylation or DNA methyltransferase activity.
p3145
aVThese data indicate the importance of genotoxic and epigenetic alterations in the etiology of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
p3146
aVTamoxifen is a non-steroidal anti-estrogen that has been used in the treatment of breast cancer for &gt;25 years (1) and lately as a long-term chemopreventive agent for breast cancer in healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer (1,2).
p3147
aVAlthough beneficial for preventing the occurrence or re-occurrence of breast cancer, the use of tamoxifen has been shown to increase the incidence of endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism (3,4).
p3148
aVAdditionally, tamoxifen is a potent hepatocarcinogen in rodents (5,6), with both initiating (7) and promoting (8) properties.
p3149
aVThere is substantial evidence that hepatic tumors in rats are due to a genotoxic mechanism resulting from formation of tamoxifen\u2013DNA adducts (9\u201313); however, events subsequent to DNA adduct formation are not clear.
p3150
aVRecently, it has been demonstrated that genotoxic carcinogens, in addition to exerting genotoxic effects, often cause epigenetic alterations (14).
p3151
aVFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that these induced epigenetic changes may play a role in mechanisms of carcinogenesis (14,15).
p3152
aVSpecifically, progressive loss of cytosine DNA methylation (i.e.
p3153
aVDNA hypomethylation) induced experimentally by different carcinogens often takes place at early stages of tumor development (16\u201320).
p3154
aVHowever, it has not yet been established whether epigenetic changes induced by carcinogens and found in tumors play a causative role in carcinogenesis or are merely a consequence of the transformed state (14,21).
p3155
aVIn our previous studies using a methyl-deficient model of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats, we showed that stable irreversible DNA hypomethylation is a key step in carcinogenic process induced by methyl deprivation and is specific only to the carcinogenesis target tissue (22,23).
p3156
aVA recent study by Yamada et al.
p3157
aV(24), showing that hypomethylation of DNA caused the development of multiple liver tumors in APC\u2212/+ mice, provided additional evidence of the importance of epigenetic alterations, specifically hypomethylation of DNA, in the origin of cancer.
p3158
aVBased on these considerations, the present study was undertaken to determine whether the mechanism of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis includes both genotoxic and epigenetic components, and whether the epigenetic alterations observed early in liver tissue in the methyl-deficient model of hepatocarcinogenesis also occur with a genotoxic carcinogen and are specific to target tissue only.
p3159
aVWe demonstrate that long-term exposure of female Fisher 344 (F344) rats to tamoxifen-containing diet leads to the formation of tamoxifen\u2013DNA adducts, a substantial decrease in cytosine DNA methylation, and a decrease histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation in liver tissue accompanied by altered activity and expression of maintenance and de novo DNA methyltransferases.
p3160
aVThese epigenetic alterations are specific for liver tissue only and are unaffected in non-target tissues such as pancreas, spleen and mammary glands.
p3161
aVThe results of the study provide the first conclusive evidence of the importance of both genotoxic and epigenetic alterations in the etiology of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.

aVAt that time, the incorporation of [3H]dCTP into HpaII- or AciI-digested DNA isolated from livers of tamoxifen-treated rats was, respectively, 2.0 and 1.7 times greater than in the age-matched control animals.
p3237
aVAt later times (12, 18 and 24 weeks) the extent of DNA hypomethylation in livers of tamoxifen-treated rats decreased slightly compared to the 6 week value, but still remained 1.5\u20131.6 times greater than the control values.
p3238
aVTreatment with tamoxifen did not change the extent of DNA methylation in the mammary gland, pancreas or spleen.
p3239
aVIn the kidney, tamoxifen treatment caused a 1.1- to 1.2-fold increase in DNA hypomethylation, with the difference being significant after 24 weeks of feeding (data not shown).
p3240
aVSince global loss of cytosine DNA methylation could be linked to altered activity and/or expression of DNA methyltransferases, the activity of endogenous DNA methyltransferase was analyzed in control and tamoxifen-fed rats.
p3241
aVIn rats fed tamoxifen, there was time-dependent increase in endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity in liver tissue with the increase becoming significant after 24 weeks of feeding (Figure 3).
p3242
aVDNA methyltransferase activity was also measured in the kidneys, mammary gland and spleen after 12 and 24 weeks of feeding tamoxifen.
p3243
aVThe activity did not differ between the tamoxifen-exposed and age-matched control rats (data not shown).
p3244
aVThe observed changes in the level of DNA methylation and endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity in liver of tamoxifen-fed rats prompted us to investigate further the expression of maintenance (DNMT1) and de novo (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) DNA methyltransferases in liver of tamoxifen-exposed and control rats.
p3245
aVDNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b are the three main functional enzymes responsible for setting and maintaining DNA methylation patterns in mammalian cells.
p3246
aVThey have distinct abilities to catalyze maintenance and de novo DNA methylation.
p3247
aVDeregulation of any or all of their expression may result in perturbations of DNA methylation patterns.
p3248
aVExpression of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in liver of tamoxifen-fed rats did not significantly change over 24 weeks of experiment (Figure 4, Table II).
p3249
aVThe expression of de novo DNMT3a showed slight, but statistically significant, decrease beginning after 18 weeks of feeding tamoxifen (Table II), and the expression of DNMT3b was substantially lower after 12 weeks of feeding tamoxifen (Table II).
p3250
aVIn contrast, the expression of PCNA in liver of tamoxifen-fed rats was significantly higher beginning after 6 weeks of feeding (Table II).
p3251
aVConsidering the well-established link between expression of DNA methyltransferases and DNA replication (32,33), and fact that tamoxifen increased cell replicative activity (34,35),
p3252
aVto determine precisely tamoxifen-induced changes in DNMTs expression in liver, we adjusted the protein level of DNA methyltransferases to PCNA expression.
p3253
aVThe data presented in Table III show that long-term exposure of F344 rats to tamoxifen resulted in a decreased expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b beginning after 6 weeks of feeding.
p3254
aVThis finding corresponds to the observation reported by Kimura et al.
p3255
aV(36) showing decrease of DNMTs expression relative to cell proliferation in transitional cell carcinoma.
p3256
aVConsidering tight interaction between DNA methylation and modifications of histones (37,38) and the results of recent studies showing that aberrant histone modifications play an important role in carcinogenesis (38),
p3257
aVwe examined the alterations in the trimethylation of histones H3K9 (H3K9me3) and H4K20 (H4K20me3) in livers of rats exposed to tamoxifen.
p3258
aVFigure 5A shows that feeding rats tamoxifen-containing diet resulted in rapid and sustained loss of histone H4K20me3.
p3259
aVThe level of histone H4K20me3 in liver of animals exposed to tamoxifen for 6 weeks was \u223c28% lower than in control group.
p3260
aVAfter 12, 18 and 24 weeks of experiment, level of histone H4K20me3 in the livers of the rats fed tamoxifen was decreased by 32, 34 and 45%, respectively, compared to the age-matched control animals.
p3261
aVIn contrast, the extent of histone H3K9me3 in the livers of tamoxifen-treated animals increased after 6 weeks of feeding and remained elevated until 18 weeks (Figure 5B).
p3262
aVThe expression of HMTs Suv-39h1 and Suv2-40h2, which are responsible for trimethylation of histones H3K9 and H4K20, did not change significantly over the 24 week experiment (Figure 6).
p3263
aVThe expression of GST-P, a marker for initiated cells (39,40), was evaluated in control and tamoxifen-treated rats after 24 weeks of feeding.
p3264
aVIn most sections from rats fed tamoxifen, immunostaining for GST-P was not detected, and only few samples contained single cells that were GST-P-positive (data not shown).
p3265
aVDiethylnitrosamine-initiated liver foci, which were used as a positive control, were intensely stained for GST-P. No staining was observed in livers from control rats.
p3266
aVThe results of this study show that the mechanism of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats includes both genotoxic and epigenetic components.
p3267
aVThe hepatocarcinogenic effects of tamoxifen may be attributed to its tumor-initiating and tumor-promoting activities (7,8,41).
p3268
aVThe mechanisms involved in liver tumor induction by tamoxifen include its metabolic activation to genotoxic derivatives by hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases through \u03b1-hydroxylation (13), which leads to DNA adduct formation (9\u201313,42);
p3269
aVhowever, events subsequent to DNA adduct formation are not clear.
p3270
aVRecent studies have suggested the link between long-term carcinogenic exposure, epigenetic alterations and the following malignant transformation (20,43,44).
p3271
aVIn light of these considerations, we examined whether or not tamoxifen, in addition to being genotoxic, altered the cellular epigenetic status of liver cells.
p3272
aVThe results of our study provided the first experimental evidence that feeding the F344 rats tamoxifen-containing diet led to substantial epigenetic changes in liver tissue comprising a rapid and sustained global DNA hypomethylation, altered activity and expression of DNA methyltransferases, and stable loss of histone H4K20 trimethylation.
p3273
aVIn contrast, non-target tissues displayed no changes in global DNA methylation status or DNA methyltransferase activity.
p3274
aVWe reported previously that stable DNA hypomethylation is an important step in the transition of normal cells to tumor cells during hepatocarcinogenesis induced by methyl-deficient diet (22,23).
p3275
aVSimilar observations have been found in response to variety of genotoxic hepatocarcinogens, such as ethionine (16), hydrazine sulfate (45) and sodium arsenite (18); however, in these studies, alterations in global and regional DNA methylation were analyzed at a single time point after formation of liver lesions.
p3276
aVAs such, it is impossible to determine clearly whether the observed epigenetic changes were induced by carcinogens and play a causative role in neoplastic cell transformation or are merely a consequence of the formed lesions.
p3277
aVIn the present study, alterations in global DNA methylation status occurred in the absence of evident morphological changes in liver tissue, which demonstrates clearly that they are directly associated with the effects of tamoxifen and are not a consequence of the morphological lesions.
p3278
aVSeveral possible explanations exist for the mechanism of DNA hypomethylation after exposure to tamoxifen.
p3279
aVFirst, the formation of tamoxifen\u2013DNA adducts may lead to hypomethylation of DNA.
p3280
aVThe major DNA adducts induced by tamoxifen, dG-Tam and dG-DesMeTam, take place at GC base pairs.
p3281
aVThe presence of these or other adducts may profoundly diminish the ability of DNA methyltransferases to methylate a target cytosine resulting in hypomethylation of DNA.
p3282
aVSecond, dG-Tam is a miscoding DNA adduct (46\u201348), that causes a variety of sequence alterations preferentially at GC base pairs (47,48),
p3283
aVwhich could lead to a loss of either 5-methyldeoxycytosine or deoxyguanosine from CpG sites in DNA.
p3284
aVdG-DesMeTam may have similar characteristics.
p3285
aVThird, nucleotide excision repair, which plays a significant role in the removal of tamoxifen-induced DNA lesions, could also lead to genome-wide hypomethylation (48,49).
p3286
aVDecreased expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b DNA methyltransferases relative to DNA replication may further contribute to hypomethylation of DNA.
p3287
aVIndeed, the results from the studies on partial or complete DNMT1 knockout cells or mice demonstrating that inadequate levels of DNMT1 cause genome-wide hypomethylation (50) support this suggestion.
p3288
aVTamoxifen-induced hypomethylation of DNA was accompanied by progressive loss of histone H4K20me3 in liver tissues.
p3289
aVRecently, it has been found that histone H4K20me3 is present through much of the genome but does not appear concentrated at any single area and trimethylation of histone H4K20 does not have any apparent role in the regulation of gene expression, instead it plays a crucial role in the DNA damage checkpoint control (51).
p3290
aVLoss of histone H4K20me3 compromises the ability of cells to maintain cell cycle arrest resulting in genomic and chromosomal instabilities in a variety of somatic cells and is associated with increased tumor risk (51,52).
p3291
aVIt has been suggested that exposure of cells to sustained stress environment results in emergence of epigenetically reprogrammed cells with specific tumor-related epigenetic alterations leading to succeeding mutations and malignant transformations (20).
p3292
aVThe result of our study shows that chronic exposure to tamoxifen leads to global demethylation of the genome, diminished expression of DNA methyltransferases and compensatory increased DNA methyltransferase activity, sustained loss of histone H4K20me3 or, in other words, epigenetic reprogramming of the liver cells.
p3293
aVThis could result in permanent phenotypic changes in liver cells, subsequently leading to a genomic instability, variety of mutational effects and neoplasia.
p3294
aVThe results of the study provided evidence of the importance of epigenetic alterations in the etiology of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
p3295
aVThe early appearance of epigenetic changes in the absence of the evident morphological abnormalities confirms that these alterations are directly related to effect of tamoxifen and are not consequence of morphological changes.
p3296
aVIn addition, these results provide experimental support for epigenetic theories of carcinogenesis, specifically of the role of epigenetic reprogramming of the genome and emergence of tumor-related epigenetically altered cells as response to chronic carcinogenic insults.
p3297
aVConnexin proteins form gap junctions, which permit direct exchange of cytoplasmic contents between neighboring cells.
p3298
aVEvidence indicates that gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is important for maintaining homeostasis and preventing cell transformation.
p3299
aVFurthermore, connexins may have independent functions including tumor growth suppression.
p3300
aVMost tumors express less connexins, have reduced GJIC and have increased growth rates compared with non-tumorigenic cells.
p3301
aVThe purpose of this study was to determine whether common flavonoids, genistein and quercetin, increase connexin43 (Cx43) levels, improve GJIC and suppress growth of a metastatic human breast tumor cell line (MDA-MB-231).
p3302
aVQuercetin (2.5, 5 \u03bcg/ml) and genistein (0.5, 2.5, 15 \u03bcg/ml) upregulated Cx43 but failed to increase GJIC.
p3303
aVCx43 localized to the plasma membrane following genistein treatment (2.5, 15 \u03bcg/ml).
p3304
aVIn contrast, Cx43 aggregated in the perinuclear region following quercetin treatment (0.5, 2.5, 5, 15 \u03bcg/ml).
p3305
aVBoth genistein (15 \u03bcg/ml) and quercetin (2.5, 5, 15 \u03bcg/ml) significantly reduced MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.
p3306
aVIn summary, genistein and quercetin increase Cx43 and suppress MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at physiologically relevant concentrations.
p3307
aVThese results demonstrate that genistein and quercetin are potential anti-breast cancer agents.
p3308
aVBreast tumors are the most common type of cancer in Caucasian women living in Western nations (1).
p3309
aVIt is estimated that \u223c1 in 8 North American females will develop breast cancer throughout their lifetime, and 1 in 30 will die from the disease.
p3310
aVMany traditional treatments, include hormone therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and surgical tumor removal, do not ensure a cure and are associated with significant physiological and psychological side effects (2).
p3311
aVTherefore, there is a need for more effective treatments with minimal side effects.
p3312
aVExperimental and clinical evidence indicates that cancer is a multi-step process reflecting genetic alterations, which drive the progressive transformation of normal cells to highly malignant ones.
p3313
aVMalignant tumors are characterized by self-sufficient growth, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, sustained angiogenesis, the ability to evade apoptosis, replicate indefinitely, and invade surrounding tissue and spread to distant organs.
p3314
aVCell autonomy and dysregulated homeostasis are central to many of these malignant characteristics (3).
p3315
aVAdjacent cells are able to exchange potential homeostatic regulators, including possible anti-growth signals and apoptotic factors, through hydrophilic channels called gap junctions.
p3316
aVEach gap junction channel is formed by two hemichannels (connexons) embedded in the plasma membrane of adjacent cells.
p3317
aVEach hemichannel is in turn composed of six connexin proteins (4).
p3318
aVPresently, 21 different human connexin genes have been identified (5).
p3319
aVThree connexin proteins have been identified in human breast tissue: Cx43, Cx26 and Cx32 (6).
p3320
aVCx43 is the most common connexin protein in breast tissue, and is most prominent in basal and lateral surfaces of myoepithelial cells.
p3321
aVCx26 has been identified between luminal cells in major ducts, and to a lesser extent in alveolar/lobular structures and in breast epithelium.
p3322
aVCx32 has been identified in mammary glands in the secretory luminal cells of alveoli during lactation and has been observed co-localized with Cx26 in non-pregnant human breast tissue (6,7).
p3323
aVMost tumors exhibit dysfunctional gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and decreased Cx43 expression (8,9).
p3324
aVAdditionally, connexin proteins may be internalized and degraded by lysosomes and proteosomes, or impeded during transport to the plasma membrane (10).
p3325
aVAlternatively, tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or excessive connexin phosphorylation can block the exchange of possible homeostatic regulators through gap junction pores (11).
p3326
aVHowever, studies have shown that flavonoids, plant-derived molecules with estrogenic activity, can maintain GJIC, and suppress tumor growth, in the presence of tumor promoters (12\u201314).
p3327
aVConnexin proteins have also been shown to have antitumor effects independent of channel function.
p3328
aVTransfection of Cx43 into human glioblastoma cells significantly reduced cell proliferation in monolayer culture and in nude mice without increasing GJIC (15).
p3329
aVAlso, the C-terminal region of Cx43 protein has been shown to reduce levels of S phase kinase associated protein 2 (Spk2), which in turn suppresses degradation of p27, a protein which halts the cell cycle between the G1 and S phases (16).
p3330
aVFurthermore, introduction of Cx26 and Cx43 into various human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, Hs578T and HBL100) suppressed growth independent of GJIC.
p3331
aVIt was found that Cx43 protein reduced fibroblastic growth factor receptor (FGFR) expression and possibly affected the expression of other proteins involved in tumor progression (17).
p3332
aVAsian females are 4\u20136 times less likely to develop breast cancer compared with North American females (18).
p3333
aVHowever, when Asian females migrate to North America and adopt an American diet, their breast cancer incidence approaches that of North American women (19).
p3334
aVThis suggests that diet plays a significant role in breast cancer acquisition.
p3335
aVAsians consume a greater quantity of soy, fruit and vegetables compared with North Americans (20).
p3336
aVThese products are rich in flavonoids (21,22).
p3337
aVResearch has shown that flavonoids have vasodilatory, antiviral, antioxidant, antiallergenic and antitumor functions (23).
p3338
aVThe most studied flavonoids with respect to antitumor functions are genistein and quercetin, which have been shown to have potent anti-proliferative effects on tumor cells by inducing apoptosis, halting the cell cycle, reducing the growth stimulatory effect of IP3 and inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity (24\u201327).
p3339
aVGenistein and quercetin can also enhance differentiation, and inhibit estrogen effects by competitively binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) (28,29).
p3340
aVAdditionally, flavonoids have been reported to upregulate connexin expression and increase GJIC in rat liver epithelial cells (30).
p3341
aVThis study investigated the growth suppressive effects of genistein and quercetin on a human metastatic breast tumor cell line, MDA-MB-231, through gap junctional mechanisms.
p3342
aVThe results demonstrate that genistein and quercetin are potential anti-breast cancer agents since they increased Cx43 expression at physiologically relevant concentrations and suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at concentrations which were not toxic to either non-tumorigenic (MSTV1-7 cells) or metastatic human breast cells.
p3343
aVThe flavonoids, genistein (98% HPLC from soybean) and quercetin (98% HPLC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).
p3344
aVThe flavonoids were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) to 15 mg/ml, shielded from light and stored at \u221220°C.
p3345
aVIn all experiments, cells were treated with genistein (0.5, 2.5, 15 \u03bcg/ml) or quercetin (0.5, 2.5, 5, 15 \u03bcg/ml) in complete medium for 72 h. The medium was replaced every 24 h during this treatment period.
p3346
aVTreatment controls consisted of complete medium only and vehicle control [complete medium supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) DMSO].
p3347
aVThe non-tumorigenic human breast cell line MSTV1-7 was used as a positive control for Cx43 expression and GJIC.
p3348
aVMSTV1-7 cells were also used to determine whether genistein and/or quercetin treatments were toxic to non-tumorigenic breast cells.
p3349
aVHs578T cells are a human breast tumor cell line, which express abundant Cx43 and readily communicate through gap junctions.

aVKi67 (a proliferation marker), Cx43 and 4\u2032-6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were combined in immunocytochemistry to test for the growth suppressive effects of genistein and quercetin and to quantify the proliferative activity in Cx43-expressing cells.
p3368
aVThe same procedure as mentioned above for Cx43 immunocytochemistry was performed with the following alterations.
p3369
aVPrimary antibody incubation consisted of mouse anti-human Ki67 antibody (1:500 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich) combined with rabbit anti-human Cx43 antibody (1:400 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich).

aVCells were incubated for 5 min with DAPI (1:34 000; Molecular Probes) before mounting the coverslips.
p3372
aVThe same immunocytochemistry controls were used as for Cx43 immunocytochemistry except that mouse IgG was used to control for the primary Ki67 antibody.

aVImmunocytochemistry was repeated on seven independent MDA-MB-231 cultures.
p3377
aVCells were rinsed once with PBS and then scraped off with lysis buffer [10% (v/v) glycerol (Fischer Scientific), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Fischer Scientific; Hampton, NH), 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Complete, Mini; Roche, Indianapolis, IN)].

aVUsing established protocols, the presence of functional gap junctional coupling was determined (33).
p3382
aVCells were grown to confluence on 60 mm plates (two plates for each treatment condition; one donor plate and one recipient plate).
p3383
aVFollowing aspiration of treatment medium, donor cells were preloaded with dye solution [5 uM calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) and 10 \u03bcM DiI (Sigma-Aldrich) in an isotonic (0.3 M) glucose solution] for 20 min in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% carbon dioxide/95% air).

aVSubsequently, the dye solution was aspirated from the donor plate, and the cells rinsed twice with glucose solution, trypsinized [0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen)] and suspended in 5 ml complete medium.
p3385
aVThe donor cells were then seeded onto the recipient (unlabeled) cells at a 1:500 ratio.

aVA total of 2.75 × 105 MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in triplicate at 10% confluence for each treatment condition (genistein or quercetin, complete medium only, or 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle control).
p3390
aVFollowing 72 h treatment, the cells were trypsinized [trypsin\u2013EDTA, Invitrogen] and suspended in 5 ml medium, and counted using the Beckman Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter).
p3391
aVData were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
p3392
aVThe treatment conditions were compared against the 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle control using the Dunnett multiple comparisons test.

aVReleased LDH in culture supernatants was measured with a 30 min coupled enzymatic assay using the CytoTox-96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, WI).
p3395
aVThe ratio of treatment-induced LDH to total cellular LDH was determined for each day of the 3 day treatment period.

aVThis cytotoxicity procedure was repeated on extracts from three different cultures for both MDA-MB-231 and MSTV1-7 cells.
p3400
aVMDA-MB-231 cells are a metastatic human breast tumor line, which express a very low level of Cx43 protein, and do not form functional gap junctions (17).
p3401
aVWestern blot analysis was used to determine the relative amount of Cx43 produced following flavonoid treatment.
p3402
aVTotal protein loaded into each well was determined by probing with an antibody against GAPDH.
p3403
aVCompared with the 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle and complete medium only, Cx43 protein levels increased following genistein and quercetin treatment (Figure 1A and B).
p3404
aVInterestingly, as seen in Figure 1A, treatment with physiological levels of genistein (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) increased the level of Cx43.
p3405
aVThe amount of Cx43 increased further following 2.5 \u03bcg/ml genistein treatment.
p3406
aVHowever, higher genistein concentrations (up to 20 \u03bcg/ml) did not raise Cx43 levels beyond that observed at 2.5 \u03bcg/ml.
p3407
aVQuercetin treatment, at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 \u03bcg/ml, consistently increased Cx43 protein compared with the 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle and complete medium only (Figure 1B).
p3408
aVInterestingly, treatment with 15 \u03bcg/ml quercetin did not upregulate Cx43 protein compared with the 0.1% DMSO vehicle and complete medium only.
p3409
aVThis was probably due to cytotoxic effects (see below).
p3410
aVImmunocytochemistry was performed to determine intracellular localization of Cx43.
p3411
aVCx43 was localized to the plasma membrane in non-tumorigenic human breast cells (MSTV1-7) (Figure 2A).
p3412
aVCompared with the DMSO treated cells (Figure 2B), treatment with 2.5 and 15 \u03bcg/ml genistein resulted in an apparent increase in Cx43 protein (Figure 2D and E).
p3413
aVFurthermore, some of the Cx43 appeared to localize as punctuate staining at the plasma membrane following genistein treatment.
p3414
aVQuercetin treatment (0.5, 2.5, 5 \u03bcg/ml) also produced more Cx43 protein compared with the untreated cells (Figure 2F).
p3415
aVInterestingly, Cx43 protein did not appear localized to the plasma membrane following quercetin treatment.
p3416
aVInstead, cells treated with quercetin appeared to retain Cx43 in the perinuclear region.
p3417
aVImmunocytochemistry revealed that MDA-MB-231 cells are heterogeneous with respect to Cx43 expression after treatment (Figure 2D\u2013F).
p3418
aVThe effect of genistein and quercetin on GJIC was studied using both the scrape loading and preloading dye transfer techniques.
p3419
aVHS578T cells are shown as a positive control for GJIC as measured by the preloading technique (Figure 3A\u2013C).
p3420
aVIn these cells, the gap junction-permeable dye, calcein, passed from the preloaded cells to many surrounding cells.
p3421
aVUntreated MDA-MB-231 cells did not exhibit GJIC (data not shown).
p3422
aVGenistein and quercetin treatment failed to increase GJIC in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3D\u2013F).
p3423
aVExtra care was taken to observe preloaded cells in contact with surrounding cells because cell density was reduced following 72 h treatment with 15 \u03bcg/ml genistein and 5 \u03bcg/ml quercetin.
p3424
aVTo test for a false negative result and to account for the observed heterogeneity in Cx43 expression in treated cells, GJIC was also measured by the scrape loading technique.
p3425
aVThe scrape loading results (Figure 3 G\u2013J) confirmed the results obtained by the preloading technique.
p3426
aVCell counts were performed to determine whether genistein and quercetin treatment suppressed growth of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4).
p3427
aVThere was no significant difference in cell number between the complete medium only and the 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle.
p3428
aVComparing flavonoid treated cells with the 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml (P &lt; 0.05) and 15 \u03bcg/ml (P &lt; 0.01) genistein, and 2.5 \u03bcg/ml (P &lt; 0.05), 5 \u03bcg/ml (P &lt; 0.01) and 15 \u03bcg/ml (P &lt; 0.01) quercetin significantly reduced cell number.
p3429
aVCell proliferation was also measured by immunocytochemistry (Figure 5).
p3430
aVKi67 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was examined following 72 h treatment with 15 \u03bcg/ml genistein, 5 \u03bcg/ml quercetin or 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle.
p3431
aVAll cells which received 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle treatment expressed some level of Ki67, and therefore were dividing (Figure 5B; Table I).
p3432
aVIn contrast, only 44.4% of cells were immunoreactive for Ki67 following 5 \u03bcg/ml quercetin treatment (Figure 5A; Table I).
p3433
aVApproximately 73.8% of cells treated with 15 \u03bcg/ml genistein were immunoreactive for Ki67 (Table I).
p3434
aVThese results support the cell count results: namely, genistein (P &lt; 0.0001) and quercetin (P &lt; 0.0001) reduce proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with control conditions.
p3435
aVCx43 staining was observed in conjunction with Ki67 and DAPI staining to determine whether genistein and quercetin-induced Cx43 contributed to reduced cell proliferation (Figure 5C and D).
p3436
aVMDA-MB-231 cells, which expressed Cx43 following either 15 \u03bcg/ml genistein or 5 \u03bcg/ml quercetin treatment, did not show a difference in Ki67 immunoreactivity compared with cells that did not produce Cx43.
p3437
aVIn order to determine whether the observed effects of proliferation might be due to cytotoxic effects of genistein and quercetin, we assessed LDH release during the time course of treatment.
p3438
aVDuring the first 24 h of treatment, a significantly greater amount of LDH was released from MDA-MB-231 and MSTV1-7 cells treated with 15 \u03bcg/ml quercetin compared with the 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle, consistent with cytotoxicity at this higher dose (data not shown).
p3439
aVNo other treatment concentrations were toxic to MDA-MB-231 or MSTV1-7 cells during any period of the 72 h treatment duration (Figure 6).
p3440
aVTherefore, the significant reduction in cell number cannot be attributed to genistein or quercetin toxicity.
p3441
aVBreast cancer is the second most frequent cause of death among North American women (34).
p3442
aVThere are effective treatments for this disease.
p3443
aVMany breast cancer therapies focus on inhibiting the ER in an attempt to control proliferation.
p3444
aVHowever, unfortunately, one-third of breast cancer patients lack ERs, and these patients respond very poorly to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (35).
p3445
aVFurthermore, many cancer therapies are burdened by significant physiological and psychological side effects.
p3446
aVFor example, tamoxifen, an effective adjuvant therapy for ER-positive breast cancer patients, has been associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic disorders (2).
p3447
aVChemotherapy is associated with physical side effects including immunosuppression, hair loss, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, weight gain, constipation and mucositis as well as cognitive deficits (2).
p3448
aVTherefore, more effective preventative and therapeutic strategies are needed to manage this disease.
p3449
aVIncreased connexin expression and improved GJIC may represent a new, effective therapy for breast cancer.
p3450
aVGJIC is important for growth regulation.
p3451
aVDysfunctional GJIC has been associated with metastatic breast cancer (36), cell heterogeneity and is one of the earliest alterations associated with malignant transformation (8).
p3452
aVAdditionally, experimental research shows that connexin proteins have antitumor functions independent of GJIC.
p3453
aVConnexin upregulation has been associated with improved response to chemotherapy agents such as etoposide, paditaxel and doxorubicin (37).
p3454
aVFurthermore, human breast cancer cells transfected with Cx26 and Cx43 showed suppressed growth independent of GJIC.
p3455
aVIt was hypothesized that the connexin proteins disrupted the interaction between fibroblast growth factor and its receptor, reducing mitogenic activity (17).
p3456
aVGenistein and quercetin have been reported to induce apoptosis and halt the cell cycle in several types of tumors including breast, prostate, colon and lung (38).
p3457
aVThis study aimed to determine whether genistein and quercetin reduce proliferation of a metastatic breast tumor cell line (MDA-MB-231) through gap junctional mechanisms.
p3458
aVCx43 is the most common connexin protein in breast tissue (7).
p3459
aVAn inverse relationship has been reported between the amount of Cx43 protein and tumor severity.
p3460
aVMost high grade and metastatically aggressive tumors have relatively low levels of Cx43 (8,36).
p3461
aVMDA-MB-231 cells are a highly metastatic human breast tumor cell line, which express very low levels of Cx43 protein.
p3462
aVOur study showed that Cx43 expression was maximally stimulated following treatment with 2.5 \u03bcg/ml genistein.
p3463
aVQuercetin maximally stimulated Cx43 protein at 5 \u03bcg/ml.
p3464
aVImportantly, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml genistein (0.26 \u03bcM) increased Cx43 protein.
p3465
aVThis result is significant because it represents the average genistein plasma concentration (0.28 \u03bcM) reported in Japanese men (39).
p3466
aVThe breast cancer incidence among Asian females is 4\u20136 times lower than among North American females.
p3467
aVAsians consume a diet rich in genistein (20) and migratory studies demonstrate that breast cancer incidence among Asians dramatically increases when they move to North America (19).
p3468
aVTherefore, it is possible that the high consumption of genistein among Asians is in part responsible for their lower breast cancer incidence (18).
p3469
aVGiven the results of this study, it would be interesting to measure the Cx43 protein levels in this population.
p3470
aVThe mechanism by which genistein and quercetin elicit Cx43 upregulation requires further study.
p3471
aVBoth flavonoids can bind to ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2, translocate to the nucleus and affect gene transcription through estrogen response elements (40).
p3472
aVThere is evidence that flavonoids can increase Cx26 and Cx43 expression by this mechanism (41).
p3473
aVHowever, MDA-MB-231 cells are ER-negative.
p3474
aVTherefore, genistein and quercetin must be able to affect Cx43 expression by a mechanism independent of the ER.
p3475
aVGenistein and quercetin are lipophilic molecules and are therefore able to diffuse through the plasma and nuclear membrane.
p3476
aVIt is possible that once inside the cell, genistein and quercetin may activate proteins involved in Cx43 transcription or directly stimulate Cx43 promoter regions.
p3477
aVGap junction formation requires that connexin proteins be located at the plasma membrane.
p3478
aVFew studies have investigated Cx43 localization following flavonoid treatment.
p3479
aVAle-Agha et al.
p3480
aV(12) demonstrated that 75 \u03bcg/ml genistein counteracted the tumor promoter-induced internalization of Cx43 in rat liver epithelial cells.
p3481
aVChaumontet et al.
p3482
aV(14) also used rat liver epithelial cells to show that Cx43 localized to cell\u2013cell contact points following treatment with 7 \u03bcg/ml apigenin and 10 \u03bcg/ml tangeretin.
p3483
aVIn our study, there was no evidence of plasma membrane-associated Cx43 in untreated MDA-MB-231 cells.
p3484
aVHowever, following treatments with 2.5 and 15 \u03bcg/ml genistein, punctuate Cx43 staining appeared at cell borders.
p3485
aVIn contrast, Cx43 appeared localized in the perinuclear region following quercetin treatment.
p3486
aVWhile these treatments did result in the appearance of Cx43 protein, this was not observed throughout the entire culture, highlighting the heterogeneity of the response of these cells to genistein and quercetin.
p3487
aVThe absence of any increase in gap junctional coupling following flavonoid treatment is not surprising given the lack of Cx43 at the cell membrane.
p3488
aVTumor promoting agents such as TPA and DDT inhibit GJIC contributing to alterations in cell proliferation and transformation (11).
p3489
aVStudies have shown the ability of flavonoids to counteract tumor promoter-induced reduction in GJIC.
p3490
aV(\u2212)Epicatechin, a flavonoid found in cocoa and green tea, is able to maintain GJIC in the presence of TPA in rat liver epithelial cells (12).
p3491
aVSai et al.
p3492
aV(13) demonstrated that green tea protects against pentachlorophenol-induced inhibition of GJIC in mice.
p3493
aVWithout using a tumor promoter in the current study, it was found that neither genistein nor quercetin enhanced GJIC in MDA-MB-231 cells.
p3494
aVThe finding that Cx43 was localized to the plasma membrane following genistein treatment suggests that there must be factors other than aberrant Cx43 localization, which impede GJIC in MDA-MB-231 cells.
p3495
aVCells must be held in close proximity to form functional gap junction pores.
p3496
aVE-cadherin is an important intercellular adhesion molecule and is considered to be the most promising candidate for cell\u2013cell interaction during gap junction formation (42).
p3497
aVInterestingly, MDA-MB-231 cells do not express E-cadherin.
p3498
aVThis may represent one explanation for the lack of GJIC in this cell line.
p3499
aVStudies have reported the ability of genistein and quercetin to halt the cell cycle, induce apoptosis, and thus regulate the cell population (24\u201327).
p3500
aVIn this study, cell proliferation analysis showed that genistein and quercetin treatment reduced MDA-MB-231 cell number compared to control conditions.
p3501
aVAn aliquot of 15 \u03bcg/ml genistein and 5 \u03bcg/ml quercetin produced the greatest reductions in cell number independent of cytotoxicity.
p3502
aVThe same concentrations of genistein and quercetin also reduced cell number in a metastatic, \u2018sarcoma-like\u2019 human breast cancer cell line called Hs578T (data not shown).
p3503
aVStaining MDA-MB-231 cells with DAPI and the proliferative marker Ki67 showed that genistein and quercetin significantly reduced breast tumor cell proliferation.
p3504
aVTo observe whether or not flavonoid-induced Cx43 had an effect on proliferation, Cx43 was co-localized with DAPI and Ki67.
p3505
aVWe observed Cx43 staining in cells which were both positive or negative for Ki67, suggesting the lack of any correlation between the presence of these two proteins.
p3506
aVCytotoxicity assays were performed on flavonoid treated MDA-MB-231 cells and MSTV1-7 cells.
p3507
aVIt was found that quercetin was more cytotoxic than genistein.
p3508
aVOver a 3 day treatment period, genistein (0.5, 2.5, 15 \u03bcg/ml) was not toxic to either the non-tumorigenic MSTV1-7 cells or metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells.
p3509
aVHowever, 15 \u03bcg/ml quercetin consistently produced a toxic reaction in both these cell lines.
p3510
aVInterestingly, 15 \u03bcg/ml quercetin did not enhance Cx43 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that the toxic effects interfered with the transcription or translation of Cx43.
p3511
aVBecause of the estrogenic effect of genistein and quercetin, there is some concern regarding hormonal side effects.
p3512
aVChromosome aberrations have been reported following treatment with very high concentrations of genistein (25 \u03bcM) (43).
p3513
aVHowever, in vivo studies have shown no short-term or long-term reproductive problems in humans (44).
p3514
aVAlthough more in vivo studies are needed, genistein and quercetin suppressed cell growth at concentrations not toxic to non-tumorigenic breast cells, suggesting that these two flavonoids could be used therapeutically.
p3515
aVThe growth suppressive effects of genistein and quercetin have been previously established.
p3516
aVHowever, the antitumor effects of genistein and quercetin on ER-negative metastatic breast cells through gap junctional mechanisms has not previously been investigated.
p3517
aVThis study provides evidence that genistein and quercetin suppressed proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells at concentrations which were not toxic to non-tumorigenic and metastatic human breast cells.
p3518
aVThe suppressed proliferation was independent of GJIC as demonstrated by dye transfer.
p3519
aVFurthermore, based on the limited changes in Cx43 immunoreactivity observed in MDA-MB-231 cells following flavonoid treatment, the major effects on proliferation are likely not due to changes in Cx43 expression.
p3520
aVPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental toxicants which act as liver tumor promoters in rodents and can be classified as either dioxin-like or non-dioxin (phenobarbital [PB])\u2013like inducers of cytochrome P-450.
p3521
aVSince we have previously shown that tumor promotion by PB leads to clonal outgrowth of \u03b2-catenin (Catnb)\u2013mutated but not Ha-ras\u2013mutated mouse liver tumors, we were interested to know whether the non-dioxin\u2013like tumor promoter 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032,5,5\u2032-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153) shows the same selective pressure during tumor promotion.
p3522
aVMale B6129SF2/J mice were given a single injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (90 mg/kg body weight) at 9 weeks of age, followed by 39 weeks of treatment with PCB 153 (20 biweekly ip injections of 300 \u03bcmol/kg body weight) or corn oil as a control.
p3523
aVAnimals were killed 15 weeks after the last PCB 153 injection and liver tumors were identified by immunohistochemical staining of glutamine synthetase (GS) and analyzed for Catnb, Ha-ras, and B-raf mutations.
p3524
aVQuantitative analyses revealed that GS-positive tumors were much larger and more frequent in livers from PCB 153\u2013treated mice than in control animals, whereas GS-negative tumors were similar in both groups.
p3525
aVAlmost 90% (34/38) of all tumors from PCB 153\u2013treated animals contained Catnb mutations, which compares to \u223c 45% (17/37) of tumors in the control group.
p3526
aVHa-ras\u2013 and B-raf\u2013mutated liver tumors were rare and not significantly different between treatment groups.
p3527
aVThese results clearly indicate that PCB 153 strongly selects for Catnb-mutated, GS-positive liver tumors, which is similar to the known action of PB, a prototypical tumor promoter in rodent liver.
p3528
aVPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are chemically stable, highly lipophilic, and persistent environmental toxicants.
p3529
aVAlthough their production in Europe and in North America was banned more than two decades ago, PCBs are still being used in many parts of the world and are present in the human food chain worldwide (Fiedler, 2001; Hites et al., 2004).
p3530
aVDepending on their chemical structure, congeneric PCBs can be classified as dioxin-like (more coplanar) PCBs that elicit their toxic effects primarily via binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Bandiera et al., 1982), similar to halogenated dibenzo-dioxins and -furans.
p3531
aVIntroduction of ortho chlorines (in 2, 2\u2032, 6, or 6\u2032 positions) of biphenyl diminishes the avidity of AhR binding.
p3532
aVPCBs with the backbone consisting of two ortho chlorines and two para chlorines resemble phenobarbital (PB) in their mode of cytochrome P-450 induction (Denomme et al., 1983), presumably acting through the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) (Sanders et al., 2005; Waxman, 1999).
p3533
aVPCBs with two or more ortho chlorine substituents may also bind to the pregnane X receptor and, like dexamethasone, induce cytochrome 3A proteins (Hurst and Waxman, 2005; Sanders et al., 2005; Schuetz et al., 1998).
p3534
aVPCBs that are AhR agonists as well as those that activate CAR show tumor-promoting activity in rodent liver at doses that also induce cytochrome P-450 (Buchmann et al., 1986, 1991b).
p3535
aVPCBs are assumed to act as tumor promoters in rodent liver by stimulating the clonal outgrowth of initiated cells, and there is experimental evidence that different types of tumor-promoting agents may act on different initiated cell populations which are characterized by defined genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.
p3536
aVExperimentally induced liver tumors from mice are known to harbor activating mutations in largely three different genes, Catnb, Ha-ras, or B-raf, which is in contrast to the situation in rats where the genetic lesions are less well understood.
p3537
aVThe types of mutations observed in mouse liver tumors strongly depend on the treatment regimen used for their induction.
p3538
aVIn mice treated with a single injection of liver carcinogens, such as N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN), a high percentage of liver tumors possess mutations in Ha-ras (Buchmann et al., 1991a; Maronpot et al., 1995) or B-raf (Jaworski et al., 2005), a downstream target in the Ras signal transduction pathway.
p3539
aVBy contrast, if liver tumors are induced in initiation-promotion experiments with PB, a prototypical tumor promoter in rodent liver, \u223c 80% of them contain activating mutations in the Catnb gene (coding for the oncoprotein \u03b2-catenin), indicating that PB strongly selects for this type of initiated liver cells (Aydinlik et al., 2001; Calvisi et al., 2004).
p3540
aVOther liver tumor promoters such as the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643, however, primarily select for cell populations with other types of gene mutations (Moennikes et al., 2003).
p3541
aVMicroarray analysis of global gene expression patterns in Ha-ras\u2013 and Catnb-mutated liver tumors revealed characteristic differences which may be used for diagnostic purposes to identify either of the two tumor populations (Stahl et al., 2005).
p3542
aVFor example, Catnb-mutated tumors strongly overexpress glutamine synthetase (GS) and several cytochrome P-450 isoforms, which, by contrast, are almost entirely absent in Catnb wild-type, presumably Ha-ras\u2013 or B-raf\u2013mutated, tumors (Loeppen et al., 2002, 2005).
p3543
aVHuman exposure scenarios generally include complex mixtures of different PCB congeners, dioxins and furans, raising the question of whether the individual constituents exert additive, synergistic, or possibly antagonistic effects (Schwarz and Appel, 2005).
p3544
aVSo far, most initiation-promotion experiments with individual PCBs or mixtures have been performed in rats and there is only a limited number of studies with mice (for a review, see Glauert et al., 2001).
p3545
aVMice would offer a valuable tool to address the question of whether dioxin-like and non-dioxin\u2013like PCBs act on the same or different target cell populations since distinct tumor types with characteristic gene mutations can be discriminated.
p3546
aVPrevious studies with 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have shown that liver tumors from TCDD-treated mice contain Ha-ras mutations at a high frequency (Watson et al., 1995), whereas Catnb-mutated liver tumors are rarely detectable (Devereux et al., 1999).
p3547
aVSince no comparable data are available with respect to PCBs, we analyzed the effects of 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032,5,5\u2032-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153), a non-dioxin (PB)\u2013like PCB, on Catnb, Ha-ras, and B-raf mutations in liver tumors that were induced in B6129SF2/J mice according to an initiation-promotion protocol.
p3548
aVThis study provides insight into the selection processes involved in liver tumor promotion by individual PCB congeners.
p3549
aVPCB 153 was synthesized, purified, and characterized as previously described (Schramm et al., 1985).
p3550
aVMale B6129SF2/J mice were treated at 9 weeks of age with a single ip injection of DEN (90 mg/kg body weight).
p3551
aVAfter 2 weeks of recovery, one group of mice received 20 biweekly ip injections of PCB 153 (dissolved in corn oil; 300 \u03bcmol/kg bodyweight per injection).
p3552
aVMice of the control group were given 27 biweekly ip injections of the solvent corn oil.
p3553
aVAt the age of 64 weeks (15 weeks after the last PCB 153 injection), animals were sacrificed and the livers were isolated and stored at \u2212 80°C.
p3554
aVFor quantification of liver tumors, frozen liver sections (10 \u03bcm) were stained immunohistochemically for GS, as recently described (Loeppen et al., 2002), using a primary anti-GS polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:20; Dako, Hamburg, Germany), and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole/H2O2 as substrates.
p3555
aVQuantification of GS-positive and GS-negative liver tumors was performed by projecting the GS-stained sections onto a digitizer screen (10- to 50-fold magnification), and the outlines of the sections and of GS-altered tumor transections were traced with a cursor and stored in a computer memory (Schwarz et al., 1989).
p3556
aVThe data were used to calculate the number of GS-positive and GS-negative tumors per square centimeter of liver tissue, the area fraction of liver tissue occupied by liver tumors, as well as the two-dimensional size class distribution of liver tumors of the two phenotypes.
p3557
aVSerial liver sections were prepared and stained for the marker enzyme GS as described above.
p3558
aVThereafter, tissue samples were punched out with sharpened cannulas from GS-positive and GS-negative tumor transections, and the DNA regions containing the hotspot sites for mutations in the Ha-ras (codon 61), B-raf (codon 624), and Catnb gene (several codons in exon 3) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using standard protocols (for PCR primers see Table 1).
p3559
aVPCR products of the Ha-ras and B-raf gene were screened for mutations by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).
p3560
aVThe known hotspot mutations at Ha-ras codon 61 either generate new or delete available restriction enzyme recognition sites (for details, see Jaworski et al., 2005) which can be detected by the following enzymes (mutated codon 61 sequences in parentheses): Hpy188III (AAA), TaqI (CGA), XbaI (CTA), BspHI (CAT).
p3561
aVMutations at the hotspot site in codon 624 of the B-raf gene (mutated sequence GAG) lead to loss of a TspRI recognition site.
p3562
aVPCR products were digested with the respective restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany, or Fermentas, St Leon-Roth, Germany) and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels.
p3563
aVEach mutation detected was verified by classical dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the PCR products (custom sequencing by SeqLab, Goettingen, Germany).
p3564
aVMutations in the Catnb gene, which are located at various positions in exon 3, were analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the PCR products (SeqLab), and the presence of mutations was confirmed by at least one independent PCR sequencing analysis.
p3565
aVIn all cases, PCR primers were used for the sequencing reactions.
p3566
aVData on quantification of GS-altered liver tumors were analyzed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, and intergroup differences in mutation prevalences were analyzed by Fisher exact test using GraphPad InStat (V3.06) (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).
p3567
aVTo analyze the tumor-promoting effect of PCB 153, liver sections from DEN-initiated mice that were subsequently treated with either PCB 153 or corn oil (control) were stained for the marker enzyme GS, and the total tumor response (GS-positive and GS-negative tumors, see Fig.
p3568
aV1A) was quantified by the use of a computer-assisted analysis system.
p3569
aVAs shown in Figure 1B, the area fraction occupied by GS-altered liver tumors was significantly higher in PCB 153\u2013treated animals than in controls, and the number of tumor transections per square centimeter of liver tissue was also increased by PCB 153 treatment.
p3570
aVStratification of tumor transections into different diameter size classes revealed that PCB 153 treatment caused a marked shift toward higher size classes when compared to corn oil controls (Fig.
p3571
aV1C), demonstrating a strong tumor-promoting activity of PCB 153 in the present study.
p3572
aVWe have previously shown that the liver tumor promoter PB strongly selects for Catnb-mutated, GS-positive liver lesions but not for Ha-ras\u2013mutated liver cell populations (Aydinlik et al., 2001; Loeppen et al., 2002).
p3573
aVTo test if PCB 153 has a similar mode of action, we now analyzed liver tumors from the present study for mutations at the known hotspot sites in the Catnb, Ha-ras, and B-raf genes.
p3574
aVIn mouse liver tumors, Ha-ras mutations are located almost exclusively in codon 61 (for a review, see Maronpot et al., 1995), the hotspot mutation site in B-raf is codon 624 (Jaworski et al., 2005), whereas Catnb mutations occur at various codons (e.g., 33, 37, 41, 45, and others) located in exon 3 (formerly referred to as exon 2; Aydinlik et al., 2001; Calvisi et al., 2004; Devereux et al., 1999).
p3575
aVFor mutation analysis, tumor tissue samples were taken with punching cannulas from GS-stained liver sections and used for PCR amplification of Catnb, Ha-ras, and B-raf genomic regions containing the respective mutation sites.
p3576
aVThereafter, Catnb mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing of the PCR products to allow identification of all possible mutations at the relevant codons.
p3577
aVHa-ras and B-raf mutations were detected by RFLP analysis using restriction enzymes that are diagnostic for the known mutation types, and the presence of mutations was verified by direct sequencing (for typical examples, see Fig.
p3578
aV2).
p3579
aVA summary of our data on the frequencies and types of Catnb, Ha-ras, and B-raf mutations detected in liver tumors from PCB 153\u2013treated and control mice is given in Table 2.
p3580
aVIn both treatment groups, tumors with Ha-ras or B-raf mutations were relatively rare and their frequencies were not significantly different, albeit somewhat lower in PCB 153\u2013treated animals.
p3581
aVBy contrast, the frequency of Catnb-mutated liver tumors was highly significantly increased in PCB 153\u2013treated mice relative to control mice along with a decrease in the frequency of liver tumors with unknown types of gene mutations.
p3582
aVSamples taken from normal parts of the liver did not contain any detectable mutations in the three genes analyzed.
p3583
aVSince tissue samples for mutation analysis were taken from GS-stained liver sections, we were able to directly correlate mutations with the GS-phenotype of tumors.
p3584
aVIn accordance with previous observations (Cadoret et al., 2002; Loeppen et al., 2002; Stahl et al., 2005),
p3585
aVCatnb mutations were exclusively found in GS-positive liver tumors (51/51) but never in GS-negative liver tumors which contained Ha-ras, B-raf, or unknown gene mutations instead.
p3586
aVData on area fractions and numbers per square centimeter of liver tissue of the different genotypes show that Catnb-mutated, GS-positive tumors are much larger and more frequent in livers of PCB 153\u2013treated mice than in corn oil\u2013treated controls (Fig.
p3587
aV3),
p3588
aVindicating that this cell population is the primary target for the tumor-promoting action of PCB 153.
p3589
aVPCB 153 is a non-dioxin\u2013like PCB congener which is known to act as a tumor promoter in rodent liver and causes enzyme induction patterns similar to the prototypical tumor promoter PB (Buchmann et al., 1986).
p3590
aVTo address the question whether PCB 153 and PB have similar modes of tumor-promoting activity,
p3591
aVwe analyzed liver tumors from an initiation-promotion experiment with PCB 153 for mutations in the Catnb, Ha-ras, and B-raf genes.
p3592
aVIn addition, liver tumors were analyzed for expression of the marker enzyme GS which is known to be overexpressed in liver tumors with activated \u03b2-catenin (Cadoret et al., 2002; Loeppen et al., 2002; Stahl et al., 2005).
p3593
aVOur results demonstrate that PCB 153 strongly stimulates the outgrowth of Catnb-mutated, GS-positive liver tumors, whereas the prevalence of Ha-ras\u2013 or B-raf\u2013mutated, GS-negative tumor populations is unaffected or even slightly reduced.
p3594
aVThese observations strongly resemble those obtained in previous studies with PB (Aydinlik et al., 2001; Calvisi et al., 2004).
p3595
aVOverall, the types of mutations observed in either of the three genes correspond to those known to occur in mouse liver tumors under different experimental settings (e.g., see Aydinlik et al., 2001; Buchmann et al., 1991a; Devereux et al., 1999; Jaworski et al., 2005; Maronpot et al., 1995; Watson et al., 1995).
p3596
aVMany of the effects of non-dioxin\u2013like PCBs, such as PCB 153, are assumed to be mediated via activation of the nuclear receptor CAR (Sanders et al., 2005; Waxman, 1999).
p3597
aVIt has recently been shown in a study with CAR null mice that this receptor is required for the tumor-promoting action of PB (Yamamoto et al., 2004), and CAR-mediated pleiotropic transcriptional responses may drive the processes underlying selection for Catnb-mutated, GS-positive liver tumors by PB (Stahl et al., 2005).
p3598
aVInterestingly, CAR is expressed in Catnb-mutated liver tumors (Hailfinger et al., 2006) but downregulated in Ha-ras\u2013mutated liver tumors which are refractory to promotion by PB (Stahl et al., 2005).
p3599
aVIn analogy to PB, CAR activation may also be causally involved in tumor promotion by PCB 153 and other non-dioxin\u2013like congeners.
p3600
aVDioxin-like PCBs, by contrast, act primarily via binding to the AhR, similar to dioxins and furans, and thereby activate a different set of cellular responses.
p3601
aVIt is therefore reasonable to assume that tumor promotion by this class of PCBs relies on other cellular targets which drive selection for other types of initiated cell populations.
p3602
aVThis assumption is supported by recent observations showing that TCDD, the most potent AhR agonist, selects primarily for liver tumors containing Ha-ras mutations (Watson et al., 1995) but not for Catnb-mutated liver tumors (Devereux et al., 1999),
p3603
aVwhich is in striking contrast to our present observations with regard to PCB 153.
p3604
aVThe question of whether dioxin-like and non-dioxin\u2013like PCBs act on the same or different target cell population is important for our understanding of interactive biological effects of PCBs and other organohalogen compounds present in complex mixtures (Schwarz and Appel, 2005).
p3605
aVRecent studies have indicated that mixtures of PCBs may produce additive, synergistic, or even antagonistic tumor-promoting effects when compared to the individual compounds alone.
p3606
aVFor example, additive or synergistic effects have been shown for combinations of PCB 77 and PCB 52 (Sargent et al., 1991), PCB 153 and PCB 126 (Bager et al., 1995), PCB 105 and PCB 153 (Haag-Gronlund et al., 1998), or PCB 153 and mixtures containing PCB 126 and TCCD (Van der Plas et al., 1999).
p3607
aVOther studies, however, have described antagonistic effects for combinations of PCB 153 and PCB 126 (Dean et al., 2002; Haag-Gronlund et al., 1998), PCB 105 and PCB 126 (Haag-Gronlund et al., 1998), or PCB 77 and PCB 153 (Berberian et al., 1995; Tharappel et al., 2002).
p3608
aVAlthough there may be several different explanations for such interactive effects, an attractive hypothesis is that different congeners act on distinct subpopulations of initiated target cells, e.g., carrying either Catnb or Ha-ras mutations.
p3609
aVBased on theoretical considerations one would expect that PCBs stimulating different populations of initiated cells produce additive effects when coadministered since they activate independent pathways in parallel.
p3610
aVWhen acting on one and the same target cell population, however, mixtures of PCBs collectively feed into the same pathway, which would cause an increase in the effective total dose.
p3611
aVIn this case, synergistic effects might occur since liver tumor promoters often show nonlinear dose relationships with overproportional effects at higher doses of exposure (for review, see Schwarz, 1995, and references therein).
p3612
aVOn the other hand, non-dioxin\u2013like PCBs may inhibit proliferation of the target cell population of dioxin-type compounds (e.g., see discussion in Schwarz and Appel, 2005), which would result in less than additive effects after coexposure.
p3613
aVSuch considerations are not only relevant for our understanding of basic mechanisms but may also have important implications for risk assessment of PCB mixtures present in the human environment.
p3614
aVIn summary, we have identified Catnb-mutated, GS-positive liver tumors as the primary target for the promoting action of PCB 153 in mice.
p3615
aVThe types of gene mutations selected for by dioxin-like PCBs are not yet known but may be similar to those observed in liver tumors from TCDD-treated mice which largely harbor Ha-ras mutations (Watson et al., 1995).
p3616
aVTherefore,
p3617
aVAspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, which is considered to be an important mechanism for their anti-tumor activity and prevention of carcinogenesis.
p3618
aVHowever, the molecular mechanisms through which these compounds induce apoptosis are not well understood.
p3619
aVHere we have found that aspirin treatment of the mouse Neuro 2a cells impaired the proteasome function and caused severe mitochondrial abnormalities.
p3620
aVTreatment with aspirin lead to a dose- and time-dependent decrease in proteasome activity and an increase in the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in the cells, which correlated with its effect on cell death.
p3621
aVAspirin exposure also resulted in an increase in the half-life of pd1EGFP, a model substrate of proteasome, as well as various intracellular substrates like Bax, I\u03baB-\u03b1, p53, and p27kip1.
p3622
aVAspirin-induced proteasomal malfunction might be responsible, at least in part, for the down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activity and neurite outgrowth.
p3623
aVFinally, we have shown that aspirin treatment caused changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-9 and -3, which could be because of the proteasomal dysfunction.
p3624
aVAspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)3 are well known to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity, the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis (1).
p3625
aVHowever, several clinical observations and epidemiological and experimental studies found aspirin and other NSAIDs to be promising anti-cancer agents.
p3626
aVProlonged use of NSAIDs has been reported to reduce the risk of cancer of the colon and other gastrointestinal organs as well as cancer of the breast, prostrate, lung, and skin (2-6).
p3627
aVThe chemopreventive properties of NSAIDs are the result of their ability to induce apoptosis and are possibly independent of their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity (7-14).
p3628
aVSeveral mechanisms have been proposed for aspirin-induced apoptosis, including activation of caspases (11-14), down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activity (15-17), activation of ceramide pathway (18), up-regulation of several proapoptotic proteins (8, 11, 14, 19, 20), and generation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress (21, 22).
p3629
aVAspirin has been found to induce both the extrinsic (the death receptor) and intrinsic (the mitochondrial) pathway of caspase activation (10, 12, 14), but how it does so is not well understood.
p3630
aVAspirin can induce up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-XL (11, 14, 19, 23).
p3631
aVThe alteration of the ratio of proapoptotic to antiapoptotic molecules could activate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.
p3632
aVThe ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the major extra lysosomal pathway of the cells responsible for the intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes (24).
p3633
aVA protein to be degraded by this pathway is first covalently attached with multiple molecules of ubiquitin, and then the polyubiquitylated proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome.
p3634
aVThe 26 S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex, which contains 20 S proteasome as its proteolytic core.
p3635
aVThe 20 S proteasome has three different types of proteolytic activities.
p3636
aVThose are chymotrypsin-like (Tyr or Phe at P1), trypsin-like (Arg or Lys at P1), and post-glutamyl peptidyl hydrolytic-like (Glu at P1) activities.
p3637
aVThe normal function of UPS is necessary for the cell growth by regulating the cell cycle through timely degradation of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (24, 25).
p3638
aVThe proteasome is also associated with many other important functions including degradation of short-lived and misfolded proteins and several transcription factors (24).
p3639
aVBecause the UPS is involved in the degradation of many short-lived proteins that are required for cell survival, it is expected that the dysfunction of this pathway will promote cell death.
p3640
aVIn fact, the pharmacological inhibition of proteasome function has been found to induce the dual apoptotic signaling pathways, depending on the cell types and conditions (26-32).
p3641
aVProteasomal inhibitors also inhibit NF-\u03baB activity, induce oxidative and ER stress response, and activate various stress kinases (31, 33, 34).
p3642
aVIn the present investigation, we demonstrate that aspirin inhibits the proteasome function, induces mitochondrial abnormalities, and activates intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

aVAspirin Inhibits Growth and Induces Apoptosis in Neuro 2a Cells\u2014Aspirin and other NSAIDs have been found to induce apoptosis in many cell types.
p3704
aVHere we first tested the effect of aspirin on the viability of mouse Neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells.
p3705
aVThe cells were plated onto 96-well tissue culture plates, and on the following day, the cells were exposed to the different doses of aspirin for 24 h. The cell viability was determined by MTT assay.
p3706
aVAs shown in Fig.
p3707
aV1, treatment with aspirin dose dependently reduced the cell viability.
p3708
aVAspirin at a dose of 2.5 mm (the concentration that can be found in the serum of patients treated with aspirin for chronic inflammatory diseases (38)) significantly increased the cell death to about 15 and 35% after 24 and 48 h of exposure, respectively, but how aspirin induced the cell death program was not very clear.
p3709
aVNSAIDs have been found to induce the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and generate the oxidative and ER stress (21, 22).
p3710
aVTherefore, we presumed that aspirin-induced apoptosis might be because of the induction of stress responses.
p3711
aVTo test this hypothesis, we checked the role of antioxidant NAC and the overexpression of various heat shock proteins on aspirin-induced cell death.
p3712
aVThe treatment of NAC dose dependently rescued aspirin-induced cell death (Fig.
p3713
aV1B).
p3714
aVAspirin-induced cell death was also prevented upon overexpression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones (Fig.
p3715
aV1C).
p3716
aVAspirin Inhibits the Proteasome Function\u2014We next tried to explore the mechanism of aspirin-induced stress responses in the cells.
p3717
aVBecause the inhibition of proteasomal function induces the stress responses inside the cells, we checked the possible role of aspirin on proteasomal dysfunction.

aV2, A and B, dose and time dependently, aspirin treatment of Neuro 2a cells inhibits various protease activities of proteasome.
p3722
aVAspirin exposure at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mm for 8 h caused about 25, 40, and 60% inhibition of proteasome activity, respectively.
p3723
aVAspirin also inhibited the proteasome activity in HeLa and COS-1 cells (Fig.
p3724
aV2C).
p3725
aVIn many experiments, we used 10 mm aspirin to reduce the time of exposure.
p3726
aVBecause aspirin inhibits the proteasome activity in cell culture, we were further interested to know the possible mechanism of proteasome inhibition.
p3727
aVTherefore, we tested the direct effect of aspirin on proteasome activity.
p3728
aVThe partially purified 20 S proteasome was incubated with varying doses of aspirin in the presence of chymotrypsin-like protease substrate.
p3729
aVFig.
p3730
aV2D shows that aspirin had no effect on the protease activity of the purified 20 S proteasome.
p3731
aVProteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin were used as positive controls, and they dramatically decreased the proteasome activity.
p3732
aVThus our results suggest that aspirin-induced proteasomal inhibition is mediated indirectly.
p3733
aVTo reconfirm the aspirin-induced proteasomal malfunction in cell culture, we checked the ubiquitylation profile because inhibition of proteasome function would lead to the increased accumulation of ubiquitylated derivatives of various proteins.
p3734
aVFig.
p3735
aV3 shows that the exposure to aspirin caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of ubiquitylated derivatives of various cellular proteins.
p3736
aVTo further confirm the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins upon aspirin treatment, we transiently transfected Neuro 2a cells with HA-ubiquitin plasmids and then treated them with different doses of aspirin.
p3737
aVThe blot was detected with HA antibody.
p3738
aVIn this case, we also detected an increased accumulation of HA-tagged ubiquitylated proteins and a subsequent decrease in the free HA-tagged ubiquitin levels (Fig.
p3739
aV3B).
p3740
aVAspirin Treatment Decreases the Turnover of a Model Substrate of Proteasome\u2014Aspirin-induced proteasomal dysfunction was further confirmed by using destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (d1EGFP), a model substrate for proteasome with 1 h of half-life.
p3741
aVThe pd1EGFP vector contains multiple proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine signal sequence in its C terminus, which can be targeted for degradation by proteasome.
p3742
aVThe proteasomal malfunction will increase the half-life of this protein.
p3743
aVNeuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with the pd1EGFP expression plasmids, and then the cells were chased with cycloheximide in the presence or absence of 10 mm aspirin.
p3744
aVResults show that the treatment with 10 mm aspirin increased the half-life of d1EGFP proteins by about 3.5-fold (Fig.
p3745
aV4, A and B).
p3746
aVIn another experiment, Neuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with pd1EGFP plasmids and then treated with varying doses of aspirin and MG132.
p3747
aVThe cell lysates were then processed for co-immunoprecipitation experiment using anti-GFP, and the blot was detected sequentially with ubiquitin and GFP antibody.
p3748
aVAs expected, aspirin treatment, like MG132, resulted in increased accumulations of ubiquitylated d1EGFP proteins (Fig.
p3749
aV4C).
p3750
aVExposure to Aspirin Increases the Half-life of Various Cellular Substrates of Proteasome\u2014Because aspirin increases the half-life of a model substrate of proteasome, we next tested its effect on the half-life of other cellular target substrates.
p3751
aVFirst, we checked the effect of aspirin on the accumulations and degradations of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and the down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activity.
p3752
aVAs shown in Fig.
p3753
aV5, A-C, the treatment with aspirin caused a dose-dependent increase in accumulation and increased half-life of I\u03baB-\u03b1.
p3754
aVThis increased half-life of I\u03baB-\u03b1 might be involved, at least in part, in the down-regulation of the NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig.
p3755
aV5D).
p3756
aVAspirin-induced increased accumulation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 is not only observed in Neuro 2a cells but also can be detected in COS-1 and HeLa cells (Fig.
p3757
aV5E).
p3758
aVAspirin at a dose of 5 mm caused about 3-fold increase in the accumulation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in COS-1 and HeLa cells.
p3759
aVHowever, an earlier report demonstrated the enhanced degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in aspirin-treated colon cancer cells (39).
p3760
aVTherefore, the effect of aspirin on I\u03baB-\u03b1 might be cell-specific.
p3761
aVInterestingly, aspirin-induced NF-\u03baB inhibition was much more dramatic than the proteasomal inhibition.
p3762
aVThis suggests that proteasomal dysfunction is not the only reason for aspirin-induced NF-\u03baB inhibition.
p3763
aVIn fact, earlier report demonstrated the specific inhibition of IKK\u03b2 induced by aspirin both in vitro and also in COS-1, HeLa, and LNCaP cells (15).
p3764
aVWe have also found similar results in Neuro 2a cells (Fig.
p3765
aV5F).
p3766
aVTherefore, it is possible that aspirin-induced inhibition of IKK\u03b2 and proteasome activity both might be involved in the down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activity.
p3767
aVNext, we checked the half-life of three other known substrates of proteasome, Bax, p53, and p27kip1.
p3768
aVAs expected the half-life of Bax, p53, and p27kip1 were dramatically increased upon treatment with aspirin (Fig.
p3769
aV6).
p3770
aVAspirin at a dose of 10 mm increased the half-life of Bax, p53, and p27kip1 by about 4-fold.
p3771
aVThe increased accumulation of Bax, p53, and p27kip1 might result in the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
p3772
aVAspirin Induces Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization, Cytochrome c Release, and Activation of Caspases\u2014Because proteasomal inhibition induces the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, we next checked the effect of aspirin on the mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release.
p3773
aVNeuro 2a cells were exposed to different doses of aspirin for different time periods and then subjected to JC-1 staining to study the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential or processed for immunofluorescence staining of cytochrome c.
p3774
aVJC-1 is a voltage-sensitive fluorescence dye that specifically detects the polarized mitochondria as red, and the depolarized membrane becomes green.
p3775
aVThe treatment with aspirin dose dependently decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential as evident from the loss of red-dotted mitochondrial staining (Fig.
p3776
aV7, top panel).
p3777
aVAspirin treatment also dose dependently induced the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Fig.
p3778
aV7, bottom panel, and Fig.
p3779
aV8A).
p3780
aVBecause the caspase-9 activation is initiated with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria followed by binding to apoptosis protease-activating factor-1, we further examined the activation of caspase-9 and subsequent events upon aspirin treatment.
p3781
aVAs shown in Fig.
p3782
aV8B, aspirin exposure dose dependently increased the activity of both caspase-9 and -3.
p3783
aVThe MG132 was used as a positive control.
p3784
aVTreatment with Aspirin Induces Neurite Outgrowth\u2014The impairment of proteasome function is also known to induce the neurite outgrowth.
p3785
aVBecause aspirin inhibits the proteasome function, we further tested its possible effect on neurite out-growth.
p3786
aVAs shown in Fig.
p3787
aV9, aspirin exposure induced the neurite outgrowth like proteasome inhibitor, MG132, depending upon the dose.
p3788
aVApproximately 50% of the cells looked bipolar (having two neurites), and the rest were round at a 10 mm dose.
p3789
aVAspirin-induced neurite outgrowth could be because of the increased accumulation of p27kip1 or ubiquitylated proteins.
p3790
aVApart from the classical anti-inflammatory function, aspirin and other NSAIDs exhibit an antiproliferative effect because of their ability to induce apoptosis on a variety of cancer cells (7-14), but how they induce apoptosis is not well understood.
p3791
aVHere we report that aspirin inhibits the proteasome function and causes severe mitochondrial abnormalities.
p3792
aVThis inhibition of proteasome function by aspirin play an important role in the induction of apoptotic signals and anti-inflammatory responses.
p3793
aVFirstly, we have shown that the exposure to aspirin dose and time dependently inhibits the cellular proteasome function and increases the accumulations of ubiquitylated derivatives of various cellular proteins.
p3794
aVThe inhibition of proteasome function induced by aspirin correlates well with its effect on cell death.
p3795
aVSecondly, we have found that treatment with aspirin inhibits the degradation of destabilized enhanced green fluorescence proteins and also various other cellular substrates of proteasome like Bax, I\u03baB-\u03b1, p53, and p27kip1.
p3796
aVFinally, we have demonstrated the dramatic changes of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol, and activation of caspase-9 and -3 upon aspirin exposure, which might be because of the proteasomal malfunction.
p3797
aVThe dose of aspirin (1-5 mm) we used can be measured in the serum of patients treated with aspirin for various chronic inflammatory diseases (38).
p3798
aVThe released cytochrome c into the cytosol binds with the apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 and forms the apoptosome complex, which in turn leads to the sequential activation of caspase-9 and -3.
p3799
aVIn fact, aspirin, like other proteasome inhibitors, has been reported to activate caspase-9 and -3 by inducing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (10-12, 40, 41).
p3800
aVAspirin, like other proteasome inhibitors, also induces the extrinsic pathway of caspase activation (14, 40, 41).
p3801
aVHow can aspirin induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release?
p3802
aVAspirin is reported to up-regulate the expression of Bax (11, 14), which can then translocate from cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane and make pores in the mitochondrial membrane to leak cytochrome c. Bax is a substrate of proteasome, and its expression is induced by p53, which is also a substrate of proteasome.
p3803
aVTherefore, aspirin-induced proteasomal dys-function could conceivably cause mitochondrial cytochrome c release by up-regulating Bax and p53 levels because aspirin treatment causes up-regulation of these proteins (8, 11, 14).
p3804
aVBesides Bax and p53, there are several other proteins involved in regulating transcription; growth and apoptosis are substrates of proteasome.
p3805
aVProteasome inhibition also up-regulates the expression of various proteins implicated in the pro-apoptotic pathway and down-regulates various transcripts involved in cell growth and survival pathways (40, 41).
p3806
aVThe altered degradation or altered expression of those proteins will definitely affect cell survival and promote apoptosis.
p3807
aVHere we have shown that treatment with aspirin leads to an increase in the half-life of Bax, p53, p27kip1, and I\u03baB-\u03b1 because of the impaired proteasome function.
p3808
aVAspirin-induced proteasomal dysfunction could explain several earlier reported effects of aspirin including inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity, cell cycle arrest, and induction of stress response (7-9, 15-17, 21, 22).
p3809
aVAll these effects can be observed during proteasomal inhibition.
p3810
aVAspirin is known to inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway, which is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory responses.
p3811
aVEarlier reports have demonstrated that aspirin inhibits the NF-\u03baB pathway by inhibiting the IKK\u03b2 (15).
p3812
aVHere we provide additional evidence that aspirin-induced proteasomal dysfunction prevents the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and thereby blocks the nuclear translocation and transactivation of NF-\u03baB.
p3813
aVWe have also found that aspirin, like other proteasome inhibitors, increases the accumulation of p27kip1.
p3814
aVp27kip1 acts as an inhibitor of cdk2 and cdk4 and is highly regulated by UPS.
p3815
aVIncreased accumulation of p27kip1 results in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase and apoptosis (42, 43).
p3816
aVHow does aspirin disturb the cellular proteasome function?
p3817
aVIt does not inhibit the proteasome function by directly inhibiting the enzyme activity.
p3818
aVHowever, aspirin could impair the proteasome function indirectly by inhibiting the expression of various subunits of proteasome.
p3819
aVOxidative and ER stress can also promote aspirin-induced proteasomal malfunction because aspirin treatment generates oxidative and ER stress,
p3820
aVand both of them have been reported to induce the proteasomal malfunction (33, 44, 45).
p3821
aVAspirin-induced mitochondrial damage would be able to generate the oxidative stress inside the cell (12-14).
p3822
aVOxidative stress can again damage mitochondria and thus generate a vicious cycle.
p3823
aVOxidative stress would be able to disturb the proteasome function either by producing excessive levels of damaged protein or by reducing the levels of ATP production.
p3824
aVAltogether, our results suggest that aspirin inhibits the proteasome function, and the impairment of proteasome function might be associated at least in part with its anti-inflammatory function as well as the induction of apoptosis.
p3825
aVProteasome inhibitors are considered to be promising anticancer agents, and recently the Food and Drug Administration approved the first proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (Velcade), for the treatment of multiple myeloma (46, 47).
p3826
aVTherefore, aspirin has enormous potential in the prevention and therapy of cancer apart from its popular use as an anti-inflammatory drug.
p3827
aV4-Monochlorobiphenyl (PCB3) is found in small amounts in commercial PCB mixtures, indoor and outdoor air, and in food.
p3828
aVIn contrast to highly chlorinated congeners that are more resistant to metabolic attack, PCB3 is more readily converted by xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes to monohydroxy-PCBs and further to dihydroxy-metabolites, which can be oxidized to quinones.
p3829
aVOur recent studies demonstrated the initiating action of PCB3 in the livers of male rats.
p3830
aVTherefore we hypothesized that PCB3 and/or its metabolite(s) are mutagenic in rat livers in vivo.
p3831
aVTo investigate the mutagenicity and the types of mutations generated by PCB3, male Fischer 344 BigBlue® rats, transgenic for the lacI gene, were injected intraperitoneally with PCB3 (600 \u03bcmol/kg), 4-hydroxy-PCB3 (4-HO-PCB3, 400 \u03bcmol/kg), 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC, 300 \u03bcmol/kg, positive control) and corn oil (negative control) once per week, for 4 weeks.
p3832
aVAnimals were killed 17 days after the last injection and the mutant frequency of the liver lacI gene determined.
p3833
aV3-MC induced a 4-fold increase of the mutant frequency of the lacI gene in the liver.
p3834
aVThe mutant frequency in PCB3-treated animals was also significantly elevated.
p3835
aVIn contrast, 4-HO-PCB3 induced a non-significant doubling of the mutant frequency.
p3836
aVThe mutation spectrum of solvent control mutants was characterized by transitions, whereas in 3-MC-animals, transversion and frameshift mutations predominated.
p3837
aVThe PCB3-induced mutation spectrum was similar to that of the 3-MC-induced mutants.
p3838
aVIn contrast, the mutation spectrum of the 4-HO-PCB3 group hardly differed from that of the control animals.
p3839
aVThis study demonstrates for the first time the mutagenicity of a PCB in vivo.
p3840
aVPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were produced world wide from 1929 to the early 1980s.
p3841
aVDuring this period, an estimated 2 million tons of commercial PCB mixtures were produced, of which about 0.2 million tons remain in mobile environmental reservoirs (1).
p3842
aVDespite the production ban and heavily restricted use, PCBs can still be found even in the most remote areas like polar regions and mountain lakes due to atmospheric transport and precipitation (2\u20135).
p3843
aVVaporization of PCBs from landfills (6,7), contaminated surface water (8\u201310) and construction material for public buildings (11\u201315) are main sources for outdoor and indoor air contamination.
p3844
aVHuman exposure to PCBs occurs to 90% via food; inhalation contributes the remaining 10% (1).
p3845
aVIn some populations, however, inhalation exposure was found to be the major source for daily PCB uptake (16).
p3846
aVCommercial PCBs are mixtures of the 209 possible congeners, which differ in the number and position of chlorines bound to the biphenyl core.
p3847
aVPCB congeners that accumulate in the food chain are mainly tetra- to hepta-chlorinated, are stored preferably in fatty tissues, and are only slowly metabolized.
p3848
aVIn contrast, airborne PCBs are lower chlorinated, and are susceptible to metabolic attack.
p3849
aVThey occur in commercial PCB mixtures (17,18), in the atmosphere (18), especially in cities, in buildings, and near waste sites (19).
p3850
aVThey can also be found in food, however in a lower proportion and more likely in/on food items like vegetables, possibly through air deposition, in vegetable oils and in dairy products (20,21).
p3851
aVCongener-specific analysis of indoor air in houses built on soil contaminated with Aroclor 1260, one of the highest chlorinated commercial PCB mixtures, showed that the congeners measured in indoor air were mostly 4-monochlorobiphenyl (PCB3, Figure 1) and 2-monochlorobiphenyl (PCB1) (22).
p3852
aVPCBs have repeatedly been shown to be complete carcinogens in rodents (23,24).
p3853
aVIn addition, commercial PCB mixtures as well as individual congeners have tumor promoting activity in two stage hepatocarcinogenesis assays (25\u201327).
p3854
aVGenerally, those PCB congeners that induce cytochrome P-450 dependent monooxygenases (CYPs) in the liver, e.g.
p3855
aVPCB77, PCB126 and PCB153, are efficacious as hepatic tumor promoters (28\u201330).
p3856
aVPCBs were reported to have no or only little genotoxic activity in most in vitro genotoxicity tests (24,31) and their potential as cancer initiators was therefore questioned.
p3857
aVRecently, however, evidence for tumor initiating activity of PCB3 and other lower chlorinated PCBs that can be metabolically activated (PCB15, PCB52 and PCB77) was provided using a modified Solt-Farber protocol in male Fischer 344 rats (32,33).
p3858
aVThus PCB mixtures could be complete carcinogens due to the initiating activity of their lower chlorinated congeners and the promoting activity of the higher chlorinated congeners.
p3859
aVPCB3 is a substrate for hepatic CYPs and can be activated to electrophiles, namely arene oxides and quinones (34).
p3860
aVThese reactive metabolites can bind to cellular nucleophiles like glutathione and macromolecules like DNA, RNA, protein and hemoglobin (35\u201338).
p3861
aVThe generation of reactive oxygen species during oxidative metabolism as well as the resulting formation of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine and DNA strand breaks have been demonstrated in vitro (39\u201341).
p3862
aVHowever, the question whether PCB3 or one of its metabolites is mutagenic in vivo was still unanswered.
p3863
aVTherefore, we investigated the mutagenicity of PCB3 in the livers of transgenic male Fischer 344 (BigBlue®) rats which contain 30\u201340 copies of the bacterial lacI gene in every cell as a mutable target sequence.
p3864
aVAnimals were treated with corn oil (negative control), the mutagen 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC, positive control), PCB3, or its main metabolite 4-hydroxy-PCB3 (4-HO-PCB3) (34).
p3865
aVMutated lacI sequences were detected after transfection into Escherichia coli based on a blue plaque phenotype using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and the type of mutational event was determined by sequence analysis of the lacI gene.
p3866
aVPCB3 as well as the mutagen 3-MC induced a significant increase in mutant frequency in the liver of BigBlue® rats, thus demonstrating for the first time the mutagenicity of PCB3 in vivo.
p3867
aVPCB3 and its hydroxylated metabolite 4-OH-PCB3 (42) were synthesized, purified and characterized as described (32).
p3868
aV3-MC was purchased from Sigma (Cat # M-6501; St. Louis, MO) and X-gal from Research Products International (Prospect, IL).
p3869
aVDNA isolation and transpackaging kits were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).
p3870
aVAll other reagents, media and media supplements were from Fischer Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA), if not stated otherwise.
p3871
aVSixteen male Fisher 344 BigBlue® rats, homozygous for lacI transgene, were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and obtained from the breeder, Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY) at postnatal day (PND) 30.
p3872
aVThe animals were kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were provided with a standard 7013-NIH-13 Modified Open Formula Rat diet and water ad libitum.
p3873
aVAfter one week of acclimatization animals were weighed and distributed at random into four groups with four animals each.
p3874
aVEach animal received one weekly i.p.
p3875
aVinjection on PND 37, 44, 51 and 58 of either 298 \u03bcmol (80 mg)/kg bodyweight (BW) 3-MC (positive control), 600 \u03bcmol (113 mg)/kg BW PCB3, 400 \u03bcmol (82 mg)/kg BW 4-HO-PCB3 in corn oil or 5 ml/kg BW corn oil alone (negative control).
p3876
aVThe doses of the PCB and metabolites were selected based on previous studies (32,33).
p3877
aVThroughout the treatment period animals were monitored daily for well being and weighed twice per week.
p3878
aVSeventeen days after the last injection (PND 75), all animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.
p3879
aVThe livers were immediately removed and weighed.
p3880
aVSmall tissue samples were quickly excised from the central part of the large lobe of the liver and these samples and the remaining liver were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280°C until use for analysis of lacI mutation frequencies and mutant analysis as described below.
p3881
aVParts of the remaining liver were used to prepare slides for histological analysis.
p3882
aVFour micron sections were prepared, placed on glass slides and stained with conventional hematoxylin and eosin stains.
p3883
aVSlides were then examined using an Olympus BX40 light microscope.
p3884
aVAll experiments were conducted with the approval of the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
p3885
aVDNA extraction, packaging and plating for lacI mutant plaque detection were carried out in a blocked manner (i.e.
p3886
aVone animal from each group per cycle) to avoid bias from day-to-day variations following the BigBlue® assay procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene).
p3887
aVGenomic DNA was extracted from the livers using the BigBlue® RecoverEase DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instruction manual.
p3888
aVBriefly, 50 mg of liver tissue were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer at 4°C, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1100× g. RNA and proteins in the pellet were digested with RNase and Proteinase K, and the genomic DNA was purified by dialysis in TE buffer for 48 h.
p3889
aVFor recovery of the lambda transgenic shuttle vector containing the lacI target, i.e.
p3890
aVexcision of the lambda vector and packaging into a lambda head, the Lambda Phage Transpack® packaging kit (Stratagene) was used with 10 \u03bcl of genomic DNA per reaction as described in the manual.
p3891
aVThe mixture, now containing the lacI transgene packaged into infectious phages (packaged lacI), was diluted to 1 ml with SM buffer [100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl and 0.004% (w/v) gelatin], and stabilized by addition of 50 \u03bcl chloroform.
p3892
aVPackaging efficiency was checked by infecting E.coli bacteria, strain SCS-8 (2 ml SCS-8 suspension, OD = 0.5) with 1 \u03bcl packaged lacI extract and plating the suspension with 3 ml top agarose onto 100 mm NZY-agar plates.
p3893
aVInfected bacteria result in plaques in the bacterial lawn.
p3894
aVFor determination of the lacI mutant frequency, a volume of phage extract equivalent to \u223c12 500 plaque forming units (pfu) was mixed with 2 ml SCS-8 suspension (OD = 0.5) and incubated at 37°C for 15 min.
p3895
aVA total of 50 \u03bcl of each 2 ml SCS-8/phages suspension were added to 2 ml fresh SCS-8 suspension and mixed with 35 ml top agarose (titer trays).
p3896
aVThe rest of the 2 ml SCS-8/phage suspension was mixed with 35 ml top agarose containing 1.5 mg/ml of X-gal.
p3897
aVTop agarose containing infected and non-infected SCS-8 was poured onto 500 mm2 assay trays (Corning, Acton, MA) containing NZY-bottom agar (assay trays).
p3898
aVThe trays were vented for 30 min before incubation at 37°C for 20 h and scoring.
p3899
aVPackaging and plating were repeated until 95 000\u2013339 000 pfu were scored for each DNA sample.
p3900
aVTiter trays were scored for pfu and assay trays were inspected for blue plaques.
p3901
aVTo confirm the mutant phenotype, and for use in DNA sequence analysis, all putative mutants from the 500 mm2 assay trays were picked, diluted 1:100 with SM buffer and replated on 100 mm diameter plates with 3.5 ml of top agarose containing 1.5 mg/ml of X-gal.
p3902
aVThe lacI mutant frequency was calculated by dividing the number of verified mutant plaques by the total number of plaques analyzed and presented as number of mutants ± standard error per 106 pfu.
p3903
aVThe lac I genes of verified mutants were PCR amplified using the following primers (named according to the manufacturer's instruction manual) and amplification conditions: 5\u2032-GTATTACCGCCATGCATACTAG-3\u2032 (forward PCR primer), 5\u2032-CGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTG-3\u2032 (reverse PCR primer), 30 amplification cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 50 s and 72°C for 60 s. Aliquots of the PCR products were characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% in TAE buffer, 5 V/cm).
p3904
aVThen, PCR products were purified using QiaQuick columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified by their OD at 260 nm.
p3905
aVA total of 60 ng of this purified DNA were used per reaction to sequence the entire lacI gene (1083 bp) in both directions using the forward PCR primer, reverse PCR primer, primer #5 (5\u2032-TCTGGTCGCATTGGGTC-3\u2032) and primer #12 (5\u2032-AGAACTTAATGGGCCCG-3\u2032) and a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
p3906
aVThe sequencing products were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems automated capillary DNA sequencer Model 3700 following the procedure outlined by Applied Biosystems.
p3907
aVAll alterations in DNA sequence were verified at least once.
p3908
aVThe same mutation at the same locus in DNA extracted from the same animal may be due to the same event and was therefore counted only once for the calculation of the mutation frequency, which is the number of independent mutations (different locus and/or different type as verified by sequence analysis) per total number of plaques analyzed and presented as number of mutations ± standard error per 106 pfu.
p3909
aVGains of body weight were analyzed by Student's t-test.
p3910
aVThe lacI mutant frequencies and the frequencies of recovered mutations were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Chi-square.
p3911
aVData are presented as means ± standard error (P &lt; 0.05).
p3912
aVChi-square test and the statistical test described by (43) using the classes \u2018transition\u2019, \u2018transversion\u2019 and \u2018frameshift\u2019 were used to analyze the lacI mutation profiles of the four treatment groups.
p3913
aVThe objective of the present study was to clarify whether PCB3 and/or its monohydroxylated metabolite 4-HO-PCB3 are mutagenic at the lacI gene locus in the liver of transgenic male Fischer 344 BigBlue® rats.
p3914
aVThe established mutagen 3-MC (Figure 1) was used as a positive control throughout this study.
p3915
aVThe bodyweights of male BigBlue® rats administered corn oil (negative control group), 3-MC, PCB3 or 4-HO-PCB3 were monitored from 2 days before the first injection (PND 35) until euthanization at PND 75.
p3916
aVAt PND 35, bodyweights of all treatment groups were similar (average 71.5 ± 4.32 g).
p3917
aVBodyweights as well as gains of bodyweight did not differ significantly during the first 30 experimental days (Figure 2).
p3918
aVHowever, at PND 65 and 75, the gain of bodyweight of animals treated with 3-MC were significantly reduced compared to the other treatment groups (Figure 2).
p3919
aVIn contrast, liver weights of all treatment groups (corn oil, 3-MC, PCB3 and 4-HO-PCB3) did not differ significantly at PND 75 (4.3 ± 0.37/100 g BW, 4.7 ± 0.64/100 g BW, 4.3 ± 0.26/100 g BW and 4.5 ± 0.33/100 g BW, respectively.
p3920
aVLiver samples were analyzed microscopically.
p3921
aVControl animals had normal liver architecture, one with rare lymphoid aggregates in the parenchyma.
p3922
aVPCB3-treated animals had only very minimal changes with or without small clusters of parenchymal lymphocytes and rare acidophil bodies.
p3923
aVAnimals that had received 4-HO-PCB3 showed dilated sinusoid and rare acidophil bodies.
p3924
aVThree of four animals had signs of minimal portal tract inflammation.
p3925
aV3-MC-treated animals had mild to severe centrilobular necrosis with various degrees of lymphocytes and neutrophiles in the necrotic areas.
p3926
aVThe portal tracts were unaffected.
p3927
aVLiver lacI mutant frequencies for BigBlue® rats exposed to corn oil (negative control), 3-MC (positive control), PCB3 and 4-HO-PCB3 were measured 17 days following the last injection (PND 75).
p3928
aVFor control animals, the mutant frequency was 17 ± 4 × 10\u22126 pfu (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1).
p3929
aVTreatment with 3-MC induced a mutant frequency of 88 ± 15 × 10\u22126 pfu, approximately a 5-fold increase over the untreated control (P = 0.004).
p3930
aVThe mutant frequency in the liver of rats treated with PCB3 was 48 ± 4 × 10\u22126 pfu (P = 0.001).
p3931
aVAlthough, elevated more than 2-fold, the mutant frequency for rats administered 4-HO-PCB3 (40 ± 12 × 10\u22126 pfu) was not significantly different from that of the control rats (P = 0.115) using ANOVA for analysis due to the very high variation within this group.
p3932
aVWhen the Chi-square test was applied, the significance of 3-MC and PCB3 was confirmed and 4-HO-PCB3 was significant as well (P &lt; 0.05).
p3933
aVSequence analysis of mutants provides information about the kind of mutation induced spontaneously or by treatment with test compounds.
p3934
aVSixteen of the 17 mutants (95%) from the vehicle-treated rats (Supplementary Table II), 47 of 56 (85%) from the 3-MC-treated rats (Supplementary Table III), 24 of 29 (84%) of the mutants from rats treated with PCB3 (Supplementary Tables IV) and 29 of 34 (83%) of those from rats treated with 4-HO-PCB3 (Supplementary Table V) provided lacI sequences that were complete, readable, and contained a mutation.
p3935
aVIn some instances the same mutation (location in the sequence and type of mutation) was identified in several plaques from the same animal.
p3936
aVIn this case a conservative approach was used by assuming that these mutations were siblings and represent a single in vivo mutational event.
p3937
aVAs a result a total number of 16, 44, 23 and 27 independent mutations from the corn oil treated control, 3-MC-, PCB3- and 4-HO-PCB3-treated groups, respectively, were identified, as listed in Supplementary Tables II\u2013V and summarized in Table I.
p3938
aVA calculation of the frequency for these recovered, sequenced, independent mutations gave 16 ± 4, 67 ± 13, 38 ± 7 and 30 ± 9 per 106 pfu for animals treated with corn oil, 3-MC, PCB3 and 4-HO-PCB3, respectively.
p3939
aVThe significance level compared to corn oil control for 3-MC, PCB3 and 4-HO-PCB3 was P = 0.01, P = 0.03 and P = 0.18 using ANOVA and P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.05 and not significant, respectively, when the Chi-square test was used.
p3940
aVIt should be noted that this is a very conservative approach, but even so, the frequencies of recovered mutations of the 3-MC and PCB3 group were significantly elevated compared to the control group thus confirming the results obtained with the less stringent mutant frequencies.
p3941
aVSimple base pair substitutions comprised most of the mutations recovered: 13/16 (81%) from untreated animals, 32/44 (73%) from 3-MC-treated, 17/23 (74%) from PCB3-treated and 21/27 (78%) from 4-HO-PCB3-treated rats (Table I).
p3942
aVMost of these mutations in untreated (69%), 3-MC-treated (59%), PCB3-treated (53%) and 4-HO-PCB3-treated (62%) rats were found within the first 400 bp.
p3943
aVSubstitutions at G:C accounted for 75% of the control, 64% of the 3-MC-induced mutations, 61% of he PCB3 and 67% of the 4-HO-PCB3-induced mutations (Table I and supplementary Tables II\u2013V).
p3944
aVThe most frequent type of mutation in the negative control group was G:C\u2192A:T transition (9/16; 56%), with 22% of these occurring at CpG sites.
p3945
aVAlso 2 G:C\u2192C:G transversion (13%), 1 A:T\u2192G:C transition (6%) and 1 G:C\u2192A:T transversion (6%) mutations were recovered from this group.
p3946
aVNo A:T\u2192C:G or A:T\u2192T:A transversions were detected in this group.
p3947
aVIn addition to base pair substitutions, 1 and 2 of the 16 total mutations from the control group were deletions or insertions, respectively, leading to frameshift mutations (19% of the total mutations; Table I and Supplementary Table II).
p3948
aVForty-four different mutation sites were discovered in mutants from 3-MC-treated animals.
p3949
aVOne mutation was recovered three times and another one twice from the same animal, leaving 44 independent mutations.
p3950
aVThe predominant mutation types were G:C\u2192T:A transversions and G:C\u2192A:T transition mutations (27% each).
p3951
aVSeven of the 12 transition mutations (58%) occurred at a CpG site.
p3952
aVIn addition, there were seven single-base frameshifts, three 2\u20135 bp insertions, and a 7 and a 67 bp deletion, leading to a frameshift mutation rate of 27% of the total mutations in this group (Table I and Supplementary Table III).
p3953
aVThe total number of transitions was significantly reduced in the 3-MC-treated animals compared to solvent controls (Chi-square test, Table I).
p3954
aVHowever, using the test described by Cariello et al.
p3955
aV(43), the 3-MC-induced mutation spectrum in total barely missed being significantly different from the lacI spectrum of untreated rats (P = 0.058).
p3956
aVOf the 17 PCB3-induced single-base pair substitutions, three mutations (18%) occurred at A:T base pair while 14 (82%) were at G:C base pair (Table I and Supplementary Table IV).
p3957
aVLike the 3-MC spectrum, the predominant mutations in this group were G:C\u2192A:T transition (30%; 7/23), with 43% of them occurring at CpG sites, and G:C\u2192T:A transversion (30%; 7/23), followed by A:T\u2192C:G transversion (9%; 2/23).
p3958
aVAlso, there was one (4%) A:T\u2192T:A transversion mutation recovered from this group.
p3959
aVAdditionally, there were four single-base frameshifts, a 4 bp insertion, and a 13 bp deletions, leading to frameshift mutations (26% of the total mutations, Table I).
p3960
aVThe proportion of transitions among PCB3-induced mutations was significantly different from that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05) and similar to the 3-MC-induced mutation spectrum.
p3961
aVDespite the apparent differences in the proportions of transitions and transversions recovered from total mutants of the control and the PCB3-treated rats (Table I), the PCB3-induced mutation spectrum was not significantly different from the spectrum of the control animals using the previously described statistical test method (43) (P = 0.117).
p3962
aVOf the 21 4-HO-PCB3-induced single bp substitutions, only three mutations (14%) occurred at an A:T base pair while 18 (86%) were at G:C base pairs (Table I).
p3963
aVLike the control spectrum, the predominant mutations in this group were G:C\u2192A:T transition (48%; 13/27), with 23% of them occurring at CpG sites, followed by G:C\u2192T:A transversions (15%; 4/27), and A:T\u2192G:C transition (7%; 2/27).
p3964
aVThere was only one (4%) A:T\u2192C:G transversion recovered from this group and no A:T\u2192T:A transversion.
p3965
aVAdditionally, there were two single-base frameshifts, three insertions (4\u20138 bp long), and a 21 bp deletion, leading to frameshift mutations (22% of the total mutations, Table I).
p3966
aVTherefore, the 4-HO-PCB3-induced mutation spectrum was not significantly different from the spectrum of the control group.
p3967
aVThe present study demonstrates for the first time that PCB3 is mutagenic in vivo.
p3968
aVIn our experiments, the mutant frequency as well as the mutation frequency of the lacI gene in the liver of untreated BigBlue® rats was 17 ± 4 × 10\u22126 pfu which is in concordance with the finding derived from the analysis of 35 independent experiments by Lambert et al.
p3969
aV(44),
p3970
aVwhich yielded an average spontaneous mutation frequency of the lacI gene in the liver of BigBlue® rats of 35 ± 3 × 10\u22126 pfu with a range of 10\u201385 × 10\u22126 pfu.
p3971
aVThe dominating kind of mutation in all four groups was base pair substitutions (73\u201381%, compared to 19\u201327% frameshift mutations).
p3972
aVMost of these base pair substitution mutations in untreated (69%), 3-MC-treated (59%), PCB3-treated (53%) and 4-HO-PCB3-treated (62%) rats were found within the first 360 bp of the lacI gene,
p3973
aVwhich is in accordance with observations of other laboratories (45).
p3974
aVThis region contains the DNA binding domain (or negative complementing region) of the lacI gene (46).
p3975
aVThe most frequent type of mutation in the control group was G:C\u2192A:T transition (56%) which is in agreement with the findings of deBoer and Glickman (45).
p3976
aVSixty-six percent (4/6) of the G:C\u2192A:T transitions recovered from our control animals occurred in the first 400 bp and 50% of these (2/4) occurred at CpG sites (Supplementary Table II).
p3977
aVG:C\u2192A:T transitions are known to be particularly concentrated in the first 400 bp, where 65\u201385% of them are located at 5\u2032-CpG-3\u2032 sites due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines (47) and the unusual malleability of CpG steps (48,49).
p3978
aVIn contrast, deletion events are 3-fold more common after the first 400 bp (45).
p3979
aVThe three frameshift mutations recovered from the 16 mutants of the control animals occurred within this region (Supplementary Table II).
p3980
aVDeletion of DNA is frequently mediated by repeated sequences and both insertions and deletions can be explained by a slipped-mispairing mechanism (50).
p3981
aVFor additional information, we added the location of the frameshift mutation in Supplementary Tables II\u2013V.
p3982
aVThe mutant frequency in the liver of 3-MC-treated rats in our experiments was 88 ± 15 × 10\u22126 pfu.
p3983
aVSequence analysis revealed that most of them, 93%, were true independent mutations.
p3984
aVIf we subtract 7% from those 88 mutants to account for possible siblings we obtain an estimated mutation frequency for the 3-MC group of about 82 × 10\u22126 pfu, giving a 5-fold induction of mutations above background levels.
p3985
aVRihn et al.
p3986
aV(51) analyzed the mutagenicity of 3-MC in the liver of male BigBlue® mice.
p3987
aVFourteen days after a single injection of 80 mg 3-MC/kg BW, a mutation frequency of 203 ± 29 × 10\u22126 pfu was observed.
p3988
aVThis seems to be higher than in our experiment with BigBlue® rats using four once a week injections of 80 mg 3-MC/kg BW, however, the mutation frequency in the liver of the control animals (76 ± 27 × 10\u22126 pfu) was also much higher than in our study, resulting in a less than 3-fold induction of mutations by 3-MC.
p3989
aVThese differences between this mouse and our rat study may be due to the differing species and treatment protocols.
p3990
aVThe predominant mutations among 3-MC-induced total mutations were G:C\u2192T:A transversion and G:C\u2192A:T transition mutations.
p3991
aVCompared to the negative control, the 3-MC-induced mutation spectrum showed a dramatic increase in G:C\u2192T:A transversions (Table I) and \u22121 frameshift mutations (Table I).
p3992
aVG:C\u2192T:A transversions were also the predominant mutations recovered from the 3-MC-induced lambda lacI mutant plaques sequenced by Rihn et al.
p3993
aV(51).
p3994
aVMetabolically activated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are known to react with the exocyclic amino group of G, A, and - to a lesser extend - C (52), resulting in G:C\u2192T:A and A:T\u2192T:A transversions and G:C\u2192A:T transition mutations.
p3995
aVThe purpose of this study was primarily to analyze whether PCB3 and one of its metabolites, 4-HO-PCB3, induce gene mutations in the livers of male Fischer 344 rats.
p3996
aVThe basis for this question was the observation that both compounds and a downstream metabolite, the 3,4-quinone (see Figure 4) induced \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive foci, which are considered to be pre-neoplastic stages and adenoma (only PCB3) in the livers of male Fischer 344 when applied as initiating agent in a modified Solt-Farber protocol (32,33).
p3997
aVSimilar to the Solt-Farber experiment, a slightly lower dose of the 4-HO-PCB was used (four injections of 400 \u03bcmol/kg BW) than of the PCB3 (four injections of 600 \u03bcmol/kg BW) to account for the fact that 4-HO-PCB3 is expected to be one metabolic step closer to the proposed ultimate mutagen, the 3,4-quinone of PCB3, and the expected higher toxicity of the hydroxylated metabolite compared to the parent compound.
p3998
aVIn this present study, PCB3 indeed significantly induced mutations in the liver of transgenic male BigBlue® rats.
p3999
aVWe did not observe any signs of liver toxicity due to PCB3-treatment, neither morphologically nor histologically, which argues against indirect effects as cause for this increase in mutations.
p4000
aVMoreover, the mutation spectrum was significantly different compared to that of control animals, with transitions, which are typical for spontaneous mutations, contributing significantly less to the PCB3-induced mutation spectrum than in controls.
p4001
aVThis characteristic was shared with 3-MC, our positive control and a known mutagen and carcinogen in rodents.
p4002
aVIn the 4-HO-PCB3 group on the other hand, the mutant frequency was elevated 2-fold, which was not statistically significant.
p4003
aVThis lack of significance may in part be due to the large variability in mutation frequency between animals within this group and the use of only four animals per treatment group.
p4004
aVHowever, the mutation spectrum of mutants isolated from animals treated with 4-HO-PCB3, was also not significantly different from that of the control animals.
p4005
aVA slight shift towards more transversion and frameshift mutations may be present, but it is nowhere near the one seen with 3-MC or PCB3.
p4006
aVEven though the mutant frequency may be underestimated by inadvertently omitting light colored mutant plaques, the mutational spectra are unlikely to be biased (45).
p4007
aVOf course, certain deletion or insertion mutations may not be detected in phage based transgenic rodent systems because of packaging constraints.
p4008
aVThus, agents whose genotoxicity arises primarily through clastogenic events are less likely to be detected in transgenic rodent systems (44).
p4009
aVFor these compounds existing clastogenicity assays, such as the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test may still be more sensitive, although organ specificity could hamper their detection even in these systems (44).
p4010
aVThe results in our experiments are therefore not sufficient to clearly answer the questions whether 4-HO-PCB3 is mutagenic in the liver of male rats, but they show that the parent compound, PCB3, is a significantly stronger mutagen with the concentrations and exposure protocol used in this study.
p4011
aVThe second goal of this study was to analyze whether the mutation spectra of PCB3 and its metabolite 4-HO-PCB3 could give us any information about the ultimate mutagenic species.
p4012
aVThis raises the question of the mechanism of mutation induction involved in the PCB3-induced mutagenesis.
p4013
aVPCB3 is efficiently metabolized by CYPs in the liver to monohydroxy-PCB3, probably with an epoxide as intermediate, and further to dihydroxylated metabolites (Figure 4) (34,40,53).
p4014
aVDihydroxy-PCBs can be further oxidized to the corresponding semiquinone and quinone.
p4015
aVSeveral reports show metabolic activation of radiolabeled PCBs to result in protein, RNA and DNA binding of radioactivity in cell-free systems (54), in cultured cells (55) and in vivo (37).
p4016
aVThe formation of such adducts by monochlorinated biphenyls has been explained by activation through different metabolic pathways (34,39,56,57).
p4017
aV32P-postlabeling studies with PCB3 and a metabolizing system showed that similar but also unique adducts were formed depending on whether the incubation environment was oxidizing or reducing (36).
p4018
aVIt was suggested that some DNA adducts of lower chlorinated biphenyls may be derived from arene oxides (reducing environment), but others may be formed from the oxidized products of catechol and p-hydroquinone, i.e.
p4019
aVsemiquinones and quinones (oxidizing environment).
p4020
aVPCB-quinones form adducts with nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles (40,56) as well as with guanosine or isolated DNA in vitro (36,40,53).
p4021
aVRecently, the structure of the reaction product of PCB3-2,5-quinone with N2 of guanine was identified (53).
p4022
aVIn addition to the cell-free experiments mentioned above, the induction of DNA adducts in cultured human hepatocytes by PCB3 has been demonstrated by the 32P-postlabeling assay (35) and quinonoid protein adducts of 2,5,2\u2032,5\u2032-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB52) were discovered in the liver and brain of treated rats (58).
p4023
aVBesides the reactivity of arene oxide and quinoid PCB metabolites towards DNA, the induction of oxidative stress might be another possible mechanism for the initiation potential of PCB3 and some of its metabolites: incubation of isolated DNA with dihalogenated PCB catechols in the presence of lactoperoxidase and metal ions induced 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine formation (39).
p4024
aVSeveral metabolites of PCB3 induce DNA strand breaks in vitro and reactive oxygen species in vitro as well as in cultured cells (41).
p4025
aVThe G:C\u2192T:A transversions recovered from PCB3-induced mutants in the present study are in concordance with both possible mechanisms: arylalkylating agents, such as activated PCB3 metabolites (e.g.
p4026
aVquinones and epoxides) react preferably with the exocyclic amino group of G, A or C (52), which would generate a non-coding DNA lesion.
p4027
aVWhen trying to interpret such a lesion during transcription, DNA polymerases usually use ATP instead of CTP resulting in G:C\u2192T:A and A:T\u2192T:A transversion, as well as G:C\u2192A:T transition.
p4028
aVHowever, G:C\u2192T:A transversion is also the predominant mutation induced by 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (59).
p4029
aVThus both, oxidative stress and/or adduct formation, could have caused the observed increase in mutations.
p4030
aVThe fact that \u22121 frameshift mutations and A:T\u2192C:G and A:T\u2192T:A transversions also seem to be increased in PCB3-treated animals, similar to 3-MC-treated animals, may be additional support for arylalkylation as mechanism.
p4031
aVAlso, the strong mutagenicity of PCB3 compared to 4-HO-PCB3 seems to argue in favor of an arenoxide as mutagenic intermediate.
p4032
aVHowever, it could also be argued that the 4-HO-PCB3 metabolite was already too reactive to reach the target organ, the liver, whereas the non-reactive PCB3 was easily transported to the liver and there bioactivated to a mutagenic species with or without the production of oxidative stress.
p4033
aVThus these in vivo experiments proved for the first time that PCB3 is indeed mutagenic in the organ where it produced pre-neoplastic lesions, but the ultimate mutagenic species and activation mechanism is still elusive.
p4034
aVPCB3 is found in the air of contaminated sites and in urban areas (18).
p4035
aVIt cannot be detected in human blood samples (60),
p4036
aVindicating its susceptibility to metabolism that might involve the generation of mutagenic metabolites.
p4037
aVIn addition, many other lower chlorinated PCBs, which are ubiquitous in our environment, may have a similar potential to be activated to mutagenic and carcinogenic species as our model compound PCB3,
p4038
aVas indicated by the observation that several of them cause pre-neoplastic foci in rat liver (32,33).
p4039
aVTherefore, the here described mutagenicity of PCB3 in vivo might have strong implication for the potential carcinogenicity of this whole group of ubiquitous environmental pollutants.
p4040
aV2-Nitrobenzanthrone (2-NBA) has recently been detected in ambient air particulate matter.
p4041
aVIts isomer 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) is a potent mutagen and suspected human carcinogen identified in diesel exhaust.
p4042
aVThe highest mutagenic activity of 2-NBA tested in Salmonella typhimurium was exhibited in strain TA1538-hSULT1A1 expressing human sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1.
p4043
aV2-NBA also induced mutations in Chinese hamster lung V79 cells expressing human N-acetyltransferase 2 or SULT1A1, but no mutagenicity was observed in the parental cell line.
p4044
aVDNA adduct formation in vitro was examined in different human cell lines by thin-layer chromatography 32P-postlabeling.
p4045
aVWhereas 3-NBA formed characteristic DNA adducts in lung A549, liver HepG2, colon HCT116, and breast MCF-7 cells, 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts were only observed in A549 and HepG2 cells,
p4046
aVindicating differences in the bioactivation of each isomer.
p4047
aVThe pattern of 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts in both cell lines consisted of a cluster of up to five adducts.
p4048
aVIn HepG2 cells DNA binding by 2-NBA was up to 14-fold lower than by 3-NBA.
p4049
aVDNA adduct formation of 2-NBA was also investigated in vivo in Wistar rats treated with a single dose of 2, 10, or 100 mg/kg body weight (bw).
p4050
aVNo DNA adduct formation was detected at doses of up to 10 mg/kg bw 2-NBA, even though 3-NBA induced DNA adducts at a dose of 2 mg/kg bw.
p4051
aVOnly after administration of one high dose of 100 mg/kg bw 2-NBA was a low level of DNA adduct formation detected, and then only in lung tissue.
p4052
aVDensity functional theory calculations for both NBAs revealed that the nitrenium ion of the 3-isomer is considerably more stable (\u223c10 kcal/mol) than that of the 2-isomer,
p4053
aVproviding a possible explanation for the large differences in DNA adduct formation and mutagenicity between 2- and 3-NBA.
p4054
aVNumerous epidemiological studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases due to ambient air pollution (Farmer et al., 2003; Vineis et al., 2004).
p4055
aVA complex variety of genotoxins in ambient air pollution has been detected (Kyrtopoulos et al., 2001), and high exposures are associated with an increased risk of cancer.
p4056
aVAmongst these are nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) which may be present on particulate matter from direct sources, such as diesel and gasoline exhaust (Tokiwa and Ohnishi, 1986) and may be produced from gas-phase reactions of PAHs with oxides of nitrogen, with subsequent partitioning to the particulate phase (Bamford et al., 2003).
p4057
aVBoth their long persistence in the environment and the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of certain nitro-PAHs compared has led to considerable interest in assessing their potential risk to humans (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 2002; International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC], 1989; International Programme on Chemical Safety [IPCS], 2003; Tokiwa et al., 1993).
p4058
aVAlthough environmental levels are lower compared to unsubstituted PAHs (IPCS, 2003), it has become clear that certain nitro-PAHs exhibit high direct-acting mutagenic potency in bacterial bioassays and in forward mutation assays based on mammalian cells (Purohit and Basu, 2000).
p4059
aVThe aromatic nitroketone 3-nitrobenzanthrone (Fig.
p4060
aV1B; 3-NBA, 3-nitro-7H-benz[de]anthracen-7-one) is one of the most potent mutagens and a potential human carcinogen identified in diesel exhaust and ambient air particulate matter (Arlt, 2005; Enya et al., 1997; Nagy et al., 2005a).
p4061
aVAs a likely consequence of atmospheric washout, 3-NBA has also been detected in rain water and surface soil (Arlt, 2005).
p4062
aVThe uptake of 3-NBA in humans has been demonstrated by the detection of 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), a major metabolite of 3-NBA, in the urine of workers occupationally exposed to diesel emissions (Seidel et al., 2002).
p4063
aVThere is clear evidence that 3-NBA is a genotoxic mutagen forming DNA adducts after metabolic activation through reduction of the nitro group (Fig.
p4064

aVThe predominant DNA adducts detected in vivo in rodents are 2-(2\u2032-deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone and N-(2\u2032-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone (Arlt et al., 2006) and are most probably responsible for the GC to TA transversion mutations induced by 3-NBA in vivo (Arlt et al., 2004).
p4066
aVThese DNA adducts not only represent premutagenic lesions in DNA but may also be of primary importance for tumor development in target tissues (Bieler et al., 2005, 2007).

aV3-NBA is a potent carcinogen after intratracheal instillation in rats, inducing mainly squamous cell carcinoma in lung (Nagy et al., 2005a).

aV2-Nitrobenzanthrone (2-NBA, 2-nitro-7H-benz[de]anthracen-7-one), an isomer of 3-NBA, can be formed under atmospheric conditions from benzanthrone, a widely distributed contaminant in the atmosphere, and nitrogen oxides (Fig.
p4069
aV1A) (Enya et al., 1997, 1998a; Suzuki et al., 1997).
p4070
aVIt has been detected in ambient air samples in the United States and Japan (Phousongphouang and Arey, 2003; Tang et al., 2004).
p4071
aVIt has been suggested that 2-NBA might be formed more specifically by atmospheric processes while 3-NBA seems to be formed preferentially by combustion processes, such as in a diesel engine (Phousongphouang and Arey, 2003).
p4072
aVIn one air sample, atmospheric levels of 2- and 3-NBA were 495 and 6.8 pg/m3, respectively, with a ratio of 2-NBA/3-NBA of around 70 (Tang et al., 2004).
p4073
aVAlthough little is yet known about the toxicity of 2-NBA, it has been shown to have strand-breaking activity in the comet assay and to form DNA adducts in human A549 lung cells and in vivo in rats, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 32P-postlabeling (Nagy et al., 2005b, 2007).
p4074
aVAlthough the genotoxic potential of 2-NBA in these bioassays is lower than that of 3-NBA, its higher abundance in ambient air urges further investigation to evaluate its potential human health hazard.
p4075
aVThe aim of the present study was to determine the mutagenic activity of 2-NBA in bacteria and in mammalian cells,
p4076
aVand to examine the metabolism and DNA adduct formation of 2-NBA and its metabolite N-hydroxy-2-aminobenzanthrone (Fig.
p4077
aV1A; N-OH-2-ABA) in human cells in vitro and in rats in vivo by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) 32P-postlabeling analysis.
p4078
aVHuman cells and rats were also treated with 3-NBA and N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone (Fig.
p4079
aV1B; N-OH-3-ABA) in order to provide a basis for assessing the genotoxic potential of 2-NBA in comparison with its isomer 3-NBA.
p4080
aV2-NBA was synthesized as reported (Suzuki et al., 1997) and provided by T. Takamura-Enya.
p4081
aV3-NBA was prepared as described (Arlt et al., 2002).
p4082
aVN-OH-2-ABA was prepared by reduction of 2-NBA with hydrazine and Pd/C catalysis, essentially as described previously for N-OH-3-ABA (Enya et al., 1998b; Osborne et al., 2005).

aVStrain YG7131-hSULT1A1 was constructed using the same expression vector (encoding the reference type variant of the protein, *1).
p4088
aVStrains TA1538-hSULT1A1 and YG7131-hSULT1A1 showed similar SULT1A1 (sulfotransferase) protein levels (approximately 0.7\u20131.4% of the total cytosolic protein).

p4091
aVThe cultures were centrifuged, suspended in medium A (1.6 g/l Bacto Nutrient Broth + 5 g/l sodium chloride), adjusted nephelometrically to a titer of 1 to 2 × 109 bacteria (colony-forming units)/ml, and kept on ice.
p4092
aVShortly before use they were centrifuged again and suspended at a fivefold higher density in medium A.

aVMutagenicity was determined using a modified version of the liquid-preincubation assay described by Maron and Ames (1983).
p4094
aVThe bacterial suspension (100 \u03bcl) and the test compound (in 10 \u03bcl dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) were added sequentially to a glass tube containing 500 \u03bcl of 100mM magnesium sulfate.
p4095
aVAfter incubation for 60 min at 37°C, 2.0 ml of 45°C warm soft agar (5.5 mg/ml agar, 5.5 mg/ml sodium chloride, 50\u03bcM biotin, 50\u03bcM histidine, 25mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was added, and the mixture was poured onto a Petri dish containing 24 ml of minimal agar (15 mg/ml agar in Vogel\u2013Bonner E medium with 20 mg/ml glucose).
p4096
aVAfter incubation for 3 days (TA1538/1,8-DNP) or 2 days (all other strains) in the dark, the colonies (his+ revertants) were counted.
p4097
aVIsoforms of human N-acetyltransferase (NAT) 2 (*4) and SULT1A1 (*1) were stably expressed in Chinese hamster V79 cells (subline V79MZ) as described elsewhere (Arlt et al., 2002).
p4098
aVThe SULT1A1 protein level of V79MZ-hSULT1A1 cells was similar to that of three human liver samples studied concurrently (Meinl et al., 2006), whereas the level of NAT2 was 20 times above the highest hepatic levels found among eight subjects (H.R.

p4104
aVFollowing the incubation of 1.5 × 106 cells in 30 ml of medium for 18 h in a 15-cm Petri dish, the test compound (dissolved in 60 \u03bcl DMSO) was added.
p4105
aVAfter an exposure period of 24 h, the test compound was removed by change of the medium, and cells of some cultures were harvested for determining DNA adduct formation (see below).

aVHuman A549 (lung carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma), HCT116 (colon carcinoma), and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK).

aVAll media were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK.
p4109
aVSubculturing was performed every 72 h when the cells were 80% confluent and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C.
p4110
aVFor treatment A549 (1 × 106 cells), MCF-7 (2 × 106 cells), HCT116 (2.25 × 106 cells), and HepG2 cells (4 × 106 cells) were seeded in T75 flasks in a total volume of 15 ml (Arlt et al., 2001b; Hockley et al., 2006) and after 48 h the appropriate concentrations of 2-NBA, 3-NBA, N-OH-2-ABA, or N-OH-3-ABA dissolved in DMSO were added, and incubated for a further 24 h. Controls were treated with vehicle, DMSO, only.
p4111
aVAll incubations were carried out in duplicate and cells were harvested by trypsinisation and then washed with PBS.
p4112
aVCell viability was determined as described (Arlt et al., 2003a).
p4113
aVDNA was isolated from cells by phenol extraction essentially as reported previously (Arlt et al., 2001b).
p4114
aVFemale Wistar rats (n = 3 per group) were treated with a single dose of 2, 10, or 100 mg/kg body weight (bw) 2-NBA dissolved in tricaprylin by intraperitoneal (ip) injection.
p4115
aVAdditional groups of rats were treated ip with a single dose of 10 mg/kg bw N-OH-2-ABA or N-OH-3-ABA dissolved in DMSO.
p4116
aVFor 3-NBA (dissolved in tricaprylin) rats (n = 3) were treated with 2 mg/kg bw as described previously (Arlt et al., 2003b).
p4117
aVIn a further experiment rats (n = 3) were treated ip with 10 mg/kg bw 2-NBA dissolved in tricaprylin daily for 5 days.
p4118
aVControl rats (n = 3) received vehicle only.
p4119
aVAnimals were killed 24 h after treatment.
p4120
aVFive organs (liver, lung, pancreas, colon, and kidney) were removed and stored at \u221280°C until DNA isolation by standard phenol/chloroform extraction.
p4121
aVDNA adducts were measured in each DNA sample using the butanol enrichment version of the 32P-postlabeling method as described previously (Arlt et al., 2002) with minor modifications.
p4122
aVBriefly, DNA samples (4 \u03bcg) were digested with micrococcal nuclease (120 mU, Sigma) and calf spleen phosphodiesterase (40 mU, Calbiochem, UK), extracted with butanol and labeled as reported.
p4123
aVChromatographic conditions for TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose were D1, 1.0M sodium phosphate, pH 6.0; D3, 4M lithium formate, 7M urea, pH 3.5; D4, 0.8M lithium chloride, 0.5M Tris, 8.5M urea, pH 8.0.
p4124
aVDNA adduct levels (RAL, relative adduct labeling) were calculated from the adduct cpm, the specific activity of [\u03b3-32P]-adenosine triphosphate, and the amount of DNA (pmol of DNA-P) used.
p4125
aV3-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts were identified using authentic standards as described previously (Arlt et al., 2006).
p4126
aVResults were expressed as DNA adducts/108 nucleotides (nt).
p4127
aVThe energy calculations and geometry optimizations were performed with the GAUSSIAN 03 program suite (Frisch et al., 2003) utilizing restricted density function theory (DFT).
p4128
aVThe nonlocal B3LYP functional hybrid method was employed (Becke, 1988, 1993; Lee et al., 1988).
p4129
aVThe standard 6-31G(d,p) basis set (Hariharan and Pople, 1973) was used for the geometry optimization and frequency analysis.
p4130
aVThe zero-point vibrational energies were scaled according to Wong (0.9804) (Wong, 1996).
p4131
aVSubsequent single-point energy calculations were performed with the larger 6-311G(2df,p) basis set.
p4132
aVThe electron affinities were calculated as described by Foresman and Frisch (1996) and the bond dissociation energies (BDE) as described previously (Reynisson and Steenken, 2004).
p4133
aVThe effect of the aqueous phase was simulated with Self-Consistent Isodensity Polarized Continuum model (Tomasi et al., 2005) using the same method as described above except that a slightly smaller 6-31G basis set was used for the geometry optimization and frequency analysis.
p4134
aVIn all the cases, the molecular species were reoptimized within the applied continuum except for the nitrated (\u2013NO2) derivatives where the structures, optimized in vacuum, were used.
p4135
aVThe Gibbs free energy was calculated according to the following equation \u0394Gaq = EPCM-B3LYP \u2212 EB3LYP.
p4136
aVThe Natural Population Analysis (NPA) (Foster and Weinhold, 1980) and Mulliken's method (Mulliken, 1962) were used to calculate the charge densities for the molecular systems at the same level of theory as the single-point energy calculations.
p4137
aV2-NBA was directly mutagenic to the standard Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1538 and TA98 even at low substrate concentrations (Fig.
p4138
aV2, Table 1).
p4139
aVThese strains differ by the absence and presence, respectively, of plasmid pKM101, encoding a translesion-synthesis DNA polymerase.
p4140
aVSince the mutagenic activity of 2-NBA was similar in both strains, overexpression of this polymerase does not appear to be important in the fixation of 2-NBA-induced mutations in this system.
p4141
aVStrains lacking endogenous acetyltransferase (OAT), TA1538/1,8-DNP and TA98/1,8-DNP6, showed reduced mutagenic responses to 2-NBA (by a factor of approximately three) compared to the parental strains TA1538 and TA98, whereas overexpression of this enzyme (in strain YG1024 compared to TA98, and YG1041 compared to YG1021) had little effect (Table 1).
p4142
aVHowever, expression of another enzyme that could catalyze the formation of reactive esters from N-OH-2-ABA, human SULT1A1, enhanced the mutagenicity 2.8-fold in TA1538 background strains and 60-fold in YG7131 strains.
p4143
aVIn the latter strains the nitroreductase gene is disrupted (Table 1).
p4144
aVThis disruption led to a 200-fold decrease in the mutagenic response to 2-NBA in the absence of human SULT.
p4145
aVThe decrease resulting from nitroreductase deficiency was less, but still ninefold, when human SULT1A1 was expressed (Table 1).
p4146
aVPlasmid-mediated overexpression of the nitroreductase enhanced the mutagenicity twofold (in strain YG1021 compared to TA98) and fourfold (in YG1041 compared to YG1024).
p4147
aV2-NBA did not induce gene mutations (determined at the hprt locus) in normal Chinese hamster V79MZ cells, at any concentration used (0.03\u201330\u03bcM).
p4148
aVHowever, when either human NAT2 or SULT1A1 was expressed in these cells, a mutagenic effect was observed with 2-NBA even at a concentration of 0.1\u03bcM (Fig.
p4149
aV3A).
p4150
aVThe concentration\u2013response curves were similar for both enzymes.
p4151
aVHowever, the expression level of SULT1A1 in the recombinant cell was similar to that observed in some human tissues (liver and small intestine), whereas the relative expression level of NAT2 was 20 times higher in the cell line.
p4152
aVIn other experiments, the metabolite N-OH-2-ABA was tested for mutagenicity (Fig.
p4153
aV3B).
p4154
aVUnlike 2-NBA, this metabolite was mutagenic in parental V79MZ cells.
p4155
aVExpression of human conjugating enzymes enhanced this mutagenicity.
p4156
aVThe enhancement was stronger with NAT2 than with SULT1A1.
p4157
aVFor DNA adduct analysis parental and recombinant V79 cells were treated with 3\u03bcM 2-NBA.
p4158
aVMultiple DNA adducts were detected in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human NAT2 or SULT1A1, whereas no DNA adducts were observed in the parental cell line V79MZ (Fig.
p4159
aV4A),
p4160
aVsuggesting that DNA adduct formation is directly linked to the observed mutagenicity in these cells (see above).
p4161
aVThe DNA adduct pattern consisted of a cluster of up to seven adducts, the major ones were also detected in human A549 and HepG2 cells treated with 2-NBA (see below; compare Fig.
p4162
aV6).
p4163
aVDNA binding in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human NAT2 (140 adducts/108 nt) was slightly higher than those expressing human SULT1A1 (108 adducts/108 nt) (Fig.
p4164
aV5A).
p4165
aVDNA adduct formation was also investigated in V79 cells after treatment with N-OH-2-ABA.
p4166
aVAt 0.1\u03bcM multiple DNA adducts were detected in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human NAT2 or SULT1A1 similar to those observed in parental V79MZ cells treated with 2-NBA.
p4167
aVSpot 1a (Figs.
p4168
aV4B and 4C) was the most abundant DNA adduct found; in the parental cell line V79MZ spot 1a was the only DNA adduct detected (Fig.
p4169
aV4D).
p4170
aVDNA binding in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human NAT2 or SULT1A1 was up to sevenfold higher than DNA binding in parental V79MZ cells (Fig.
p4171
aV5B).
p4172
aVHuman cells (A549, HepG2, HCT116, and MCF-7) treated with 2-NBA, 3-NBA, N-OH-2-ABA, or N-OH-3-ABA were analyzed by TLC 32P-postlabeling using butanol enrichment.
p4173
aVIn A549 and HepG2 cells, the DNA adduct pattern induced by 2-NBA consisted of a cluster of up to five adduct spots (adducts 1a\u20135a) (Figs.
p4174
aV6Aa and 6Ba).
p4175
aVNo DNA adducts were detected in control cells (data not shown).
p4176
aVDNA adduct formation was concentration dependent, with relative adduct levels of 165/108 nt and 213/108 nt in A549 and HepG2 cells at the highest 2-NBA concentration (5\u03bcM) tested, respectively (Fig.
p4177
aV7A).
p4178
aVSimilarly, DNA adduct formation was observed in A549 and HepG2 cells treated with 3-NBA (Figs.
p4179
aV6Ab and 6Bb); however, DNA binding by 3-NBA was up to 14-fold higher than by 2-NBA in HepG2 cells (Fig.
p4180
aV7B).
p4181
aVInterestingly, no 2-NBA-derived DNA adducts were found in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells (Figs.
p4182
aV6Ca and 6Da), whereas under the same experimental conditions DNA adduct formation by 3-NBA was observed clearly (Figs.
p4183
aV6Cb and 6Db).
p4184
aVDNA adducts were detected in all human cells treated with N-OH-2-ABA (Fig.
p4185
aV6Ac\u2212Dc).
p4186
aVThe DNA adduct pattern consisted of a cluster of up to five adduct spots (adducts 1a\u20135a), adducts 1a, 2a, and 3a being the major ones detected, similar to the adduct pattern observed in 2-NBA\u2013treated A549 and HepG2 cells (compare Figs.
p4187
aV6Aa and 6Ba).
p4188
aVThe extent of DNA binding in the latter cells treated with 2-NBA and N-OH-2-ABA was similar (Fig.
p4189
aV7C).
p4190
aVThe same characteristic DNA adduct pattern was found in all human cells treated with N-OH-3-ABA as that formed by 3-NBA (Fig.
p4191
aV6Ad\u2212Dd).
p4192
aVHowever, DNA binding by N-OH-3-ABA in human cells was lower compared with 3-NBA (Figs.
p4193
aV7B and 7C), whereas the extent of DNA binding by N-OH-2-ABA and N-OH-3-ABA varied markedly between cell lines (Fig.
p4194
aV7C).
p4195
aVThe formation of DNA adducts in various organs (liver, lung, pancreas, colon, and kidney) of female Wistar rats treated with 2- or 3-NBA was analyzed using the butanol enrichment version of the TLC 32P-postlabeling method (Fig.
p4196
aV8; Table 2).
p4197
aVAs shown in Figure 8C 3-NBA\u2013specific DNA adduct patterns identical to those found previously (Arlt et al., 2001a, 2003b, 2006) were detected in all organs of rats treated with 2 mg/kg bw 3-NBA.
p4198
aVDNA binding was similar to that found in a study performed previously under the same experimental conditions,
p4199
aValthough DNA binding in pancreas was approximately threefold lower in the present study (Arlt et al., 2003b).
p4200
aVThe highest DNA binding was observed in kidney with 134 adducts/108 nt, followed by lung (89/108 nt), colon (87/108 nt), and pancreas (84/108 nt) (Table 2).
p4201
aVIn contrast, using equal amounts of 2-NBA (2 mg/kg bw; single administration) DNA adducts were not detectable in any of the organs investigated (Fig.
p4202
aV8B; Table 2).
p4203
aVNo DNA adducts were observed in controls (Fig.
p4204
aV8A).
p4205
aVSingle or repeated (once daily for 5 days) treatment of rats with 10 mg/kg bw 2-NBA also resulted in no DNA adduct formation in any of the organs (Figs.
p4206
aV8D and 8E; Table 2).
p4207
aVOnly a single treatment with 100 mg/kg bw 2-NBA resulted in the formation of DNA adducts at a low level (5 adducts/108 nt) in lung (Fig.
p4208
aV8Fa), but not in liver (Fig.
p4209
aV8Fb), pancreas, colon, or kidney (Table 2).
p4210
aVIn lung one adduct was detected (Fig.
p4211
aV8Fa) and comparative analyses on TLC indicated that it was chromatographically indistinguishable from adduct 2a found in DNA of human cells treated with 2-NBA (compare Fig.
p4212
aV6).
p4213
aVWe also examined DNA adducts in female Wistar rats treated with 10 mg/kg bw of the reactive N-hydroxy arylamine metabolites, N-OH-2-ABA and N-OH-3-ABA (Fig.
p4214
aV9; Table 2).
p4215
aVCharacteristic DNA adduct patterns were observed in all organs investigated (liver, lung, pancreas, colon, and kidney) in rats treated with N-OH-3-ABA (Fig.
p4216
aV9C), identical to those found with the parent nitro-PAH (compare Fig.
p4217
aV8C).
p4218
aVThe highest DNA adduct levels were found in pancreas (430/108 nt), followed by lung (312/108 nt) and kidney (262/108 nt) (Table 2).
p4219
aVIn rats treated with N-OH-2-ABA DNA adducts were found in all organs investigated, although DNA binding was quite low, in the range of 1\u20132 adducts/108 nt (Table 2).
p4220
aVThe DNA adduct pattern consisted of two adducts in lung, kidney, colon, and pancreas, whereas only one adduct was detectable in liver (Fig.
p4221
aV9B).
p4222
aVComparative analyses on TLC with DNA of human cells treated with 2-NBA indicated that these two adducts were chromatographically indistinguishable from adducts 1a and 2a (compare Fig.
p4223
aV6).
p4224
aVPreviously, it has been shown that the activity of cytosolic nitroreductases toward certain nitro-aromatics is closely related to their single-electron reduction potential (Iwata et al., 1992).
p4225
aVThis implies that the rate determining step in this process is the addition of an electron to the organic molecule, in particular its nitroreduction.
p4226
aVTherefore, as shown in Figure 1 we calculated the electron affinity for 2- and 3-NBA which reflects the energy required to reduce them.
p4227
aVThe electron addition without solvent simulation is exothermic for both isomers with \u221242.8 and \u221247.6 kcal/mol for 2- and 3-NBA, respectively, the 2-isomer reduction being slightly less exothermic.
p4228
aVTaking into account the effects of the aqueous phase the exothermicity increases considerably to \u221271.6 and \u221277.4 kcal/mol for 2- and 3-NBA, respectively.
p4229
aVThis increase is mainly due to the enhanced solubility of the radical anions compared to their parent compounds by \u223c30 kcal/mol.
p4230
aVBoth isomers are easily reduced according to these calculations.
p4231
aVThe heterolytic BDE for both N-OH-ABAs (Fig.
p4232
aV1) were also calculated.
p4233
aVIn vacuum N-OH-2-ABA has \u223c15 kcal/mol larger BDE than N-OH-3-ABA.
p4234
aVTo include the effects of the aqueous phase several aspects need to be taken into account since it involves protonation and formation of water as the leaving group.
p4235
aVFirst, the \u0394Gaq for N-OH-2-ABA is calculated to be \u22124.9 kcal/mol and \u22124.8 kcal/mol for N-OH-3-ABA; the \u0394Gaq for their corresponding nitrenium cations are \u221248.5 and \u221245.6 kcal/mol, respectively.
p4236
aVSecond, for the protonation of the OH-moiety H+ was dehydrated from the aqueous phase.
p4237
aVThe measured hydration energy of a proton is \u0394Gaq = \u2212263.9 kcal/mol (Tissandier et al., 1998).
p4238
aVThirdly, a heterolytic bond formation of water occurs and this energy has been experimentally determined as \u2212390.7 kcal/mol (Schulz et al., 1982).
p4239
aVCombining these values, as shown in Figure 1, both isomers display moderate exothermicities in the 30 to 40 kcal/mol range,
p4240
aVi.e., the water elimination is expected to occur and not to be the rate limiting step in this reaction cascade, although the activation energy may play a role.
p4241
aVThe relative stability of the nitrenium intermediate appears to be a crucial factor in determining the biological activity of aromatic amines (Kadlubar and Beland, 1985).
p4242
aVTherefore, the relative energies, or energy difference, of the nitrenium cations and their related amino compounds, 2- and 3-ABA, as a comparative model, were calculated.
p4243
aVThe energy difference between the amino compounds (2- and 3-ABA) was negligible with (0.5 kcal/mol) and without (\u22120.2 kcal/mol) solvent simulation (data not shown).
p4244
aVHowever, a large difference was observed for the corresponding nitrenium ions, that of the 3-isomer being much more stable than its 2-isomer by \u22129.4 kcal/mol with and \u221212.2 kcal/mol without solvent simulation (data not shown).
p4245
aVThis observation can be explained in terms of the possible conjugation patterns of these two systems as seen in Figure 10, i.e., the 3-isomer delocalizes the nitrenium ion positive charge in a more effective way than the 2-isomer.
p4246
aVAlthough the aqueous solution stabilizes the organic cations, reducing to some extent the energy difference between them, the difference is still being considerable, indicating that the nitrenium ion of the 2-isomer is conceivably more reactive than that of the 3-isomer.
p4247
aVThe charge distribution was calculated with both the Mulliken and the NPA methods (Fig.
p4248
aV10).
p4249
aVIn order to elucidate the conjugation pattern of the nitrenium cations their charge difference between them and their amino counterparts were derived.
p4250
aVBy performing this subtraction it is possible to locate the atoms that are principally affected by the introduction of a positive charge to the conjugated systems of these rigid and planar molecules.
p4251
aVThese results show that the 3-isomer delocalizes the charge more effectively than the 2-isomer, which correlates with the energy calculations.
p4252
aVThe solvent effects on the charge distribution were insignificant.
p4253
aVThe fact that both the Mulliken and NPA methods predicted similar changes in charge densities for both isomers investigated supports the reliability of the theoretical methods used.
p4254
aVIn a recently published mutagenicity study conducted independently of the present investigations, 2-NBA was around 2000 times less potent than 3-NBA in YG1024, the strain with the highest response toward 3-NBA (Takamura-Enya et al., 2006).
p4255
aVSome strains (TA98, TA98/1,8-DNP6, YG1021, and YG1024) have been used as well in our investigation.
p4256
aVThe largest difference between the studies is seen in strain TA98, with 160 revertants/nmol in the previous study and 3000 revertants/nmol in the present study.
p4257
aVThe higher response in our study might be due to differences in the assay conditions; we use higher cell densities, a longer liquid-preincubation time, and culture media higher in magnesium sulfate (essential for SULT-expressing strains) than other laboratories.
p4258
aVInterestingly, deficiency of OAT reduced the response, whereas overexpression of this enzyme had practically no influence on the mutagenic activity of 2-NBA in our study.
p4259
aVHowever, previously no influence of OAT deficiency was found, but a marked enhancement of the mutagenicity by overexpression of OAT.
p4260
aVThus, it may be suspected that OAT was more active under the experimental conditions used in the present study.
p4261
aVIn both studies, nitroreductase deficiency drastically reduced the mutagenic activity of 2-NBA, whereas overexpression of this enzyme enhanced the activity.
p4262
aVStrains expressing a human SULT were used only in our study.
p4263
aVExpression of SULT1A1 enhanced the mutagenicity of 2-NBA.
p4264
aVThe increase amounted to 2.8-fold using TA1538 as the recipient strain.
p4265
aVIt was stronger (60-fold) with the nitroreductase-deficient recipient strain YG7131, starting from a much lower background level than in TA1538.
p4266
aVThus, it may be hypothesized that human SULT1A1 was superior to the bacterial acetyltransferase in bioactivation at the low substrate concentrations of N-OH-2-ABA intermediate expected to be present in nitroreductase-deficient strains.
p4267
aVIn the present study it is reported for the first time that 2-NBA is capable of inducing gene mutations in mammalian cells.
p4268
aVMutagenicity was not observed in the parental V79MZ cell line, which is used in standard gene mutation, micronucleus and chromosomal aberration tests.
p4269
aVHowever, when human NAT2 or SULT1A1 were expressed in this cell line, mutagenicity was detected even at very low concentrations of 2-NBA (0.1\u03bcM).
p4270
aVUnlike 2-NBA, its metabolite N-OH-2-ABA was mutagenic in parental V79MZ cells.
p4271
aVIt is not known whether N-OH-2-ABA or another metabolite produced by the V79MZ cells induced the mutations.
p4272
aVExpression of human NAT2 or SULT1A1 enhanced the mutagenicity of N-OH-2-ABA, in agreement with the effects observed on 2-NBA.
p4273
aVUsing TLC 32P-postlabeling multiple DNA adducts were detectable in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human NAT2 or SULT1A1 treated with 2-NBA (3\u03bcM) similar to those observed in human cells (see below), whereas no DNA adducts were found in the parental cell line V79MZ.
p4274
aVHigher DNA binding was also observed in V79MZ-derived cells expressing human conjugating enzymes compared to parental cells after treatment with N-OH-2-ABA at the low concentration tested (0.1\u03bcM).
p4275
aVThus, expression of human conjugating enzymes NAT2 or SULT1A1 strongly contributes to the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of 2-NBA and N-OH-2-ABA as has been observed previously for 3-NBA (Arlt et al., 2002, 2003a, 2005).
p4276
aVDifferences in the modulating effects of the enzymes may be due to variations in the time course of the exposure to N-OH-2-ABA, i.e., initially high with a relatively rapid decrease when N-OH-2-ABA is directly used, lower but more continuous when it is produced by the cells from 2-NBA.
p4277
aVWhen human cells treated with 2-NBA were used to investigate DNA adduct formation a cluster of up to five adducts were detected using TLC 32P-postlabeling.
p4278
aVAll of them were primarily located in a diagonal zone on the TLC plates at approximately 45° to elution directions D3 and D4, similar to DNA adducts formed by 3-NBA (Arlt et al., 2001a, 2006; Osborne et al., 2005) and typical of DNA adducts derived from extracts of airborne particulate matter and diesel exhaust (Gallagher et al., 1991; Gupta, 1985).
p4279
aVIn a recent study 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts were observed in A549 and HepG2 cells by HPLC 32P-postlabeling (Nagy et al., 2007), at levels about 1/3 and 1/20, respectively, of the levels of 3-NBA\u2013DNA adduct formation.
p4280
aVHepG2 cells have been proven to be a sensitive cell line to examine the genotoxicity of 3-NBA as measured by the induction of single strand breaks (comet assay) and micronuclei (Lamy et al., 2004).
p4281
aVSimilarly, in the present study HepG2 cells were the most sensitive human cell line but DNA adduct levels derived from 3-NBA were up to 2.5- and 14-fold higher than by 2-NBA in A549 and HepG2 cells, respectively.
p4282
aVIn contrast to 3-NBA, surprisingly, no DNA adduct formation was observed in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells, indicating that these human cells are not metabolically competent to activate 2-NBA.
p4283
aVSince DNA adducts were detected in all human cells exposed to N-OH-2-ABA, it seems that 2-NBA is a poor substrate for nitroreductases in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells.
p4284
aVMCF-7 cells are capable of activating other nitro-PAHs by simple nitroreduction leading to the formation of covalent DNA adducts (Arlt et al., 2001b; Sun et al., 2004).
p4285
aVMoreover, it has been shown that DNA binding varied among different mononitropyrene isomers tested, with 4-nitropyrene binding to DNA in MCF-7 cells to a greater extent than 1- and 2-nitropyrene (Sun et al., 2004).
p4286
aVThus, it remains to be investigated which enzyme(s) are responsible for the reduction and subsequent metabolic activation of 3-NBA, but not 2-NBA, in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells.
p4287
aVNitroreduction for 3-NBA is primarily catalyzed by cytosolic nitroreductases such as NQO1 (Arlt et al., 2005; Stiborova et al., 2006).
p4288
aVTherefore, further studies will focus on the ability of human NQO1 to bioactivate 2-NBA.
p4289
aVIn addition, investigations on the expression of cytosolic and microsomal reductases in A549, HepG2, HCT116, and MCF-7 cells after exposure to 2- and 3-NBA may help to explain these findings.
p4290
aVDuring the preparation of this manuscript, others investigated DNA adduct formation by 2-NBA in vivo (Nagy et al., 2007).
p4291
aVDNA adduct formation in F344 rats after a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg bw 2-NBA was examined by HPLC 32P-postlabeling.
p4292
aVSeveral peaks on the HPLC related to 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adduct formation were found at an overall level approximately 80% of that formed by 3-NBA.
p4293
aVIn contrast, in the present study we did not detect DNA adduct formation at doses of up to 10 mg/kg bw 2-NBA after intraperitoneal treatment, after either single or repeated administration.
p4294
aVOnly after administration of one high dose of 100 mg/kg bw 2-NBA was a low level of DNA adduct formation detected, and then only in lung tissue.
p4295
aVIn the light of the detection of 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts in vivo at lower doses by Nagy and coworkers we would have expected to observe DNA adduct formation in the present study.
p4296
aVIt should be noted that in the two studies different strains of rats were used (Wistar vs. F344 rats), different routes of administration were applied (intraperitoneal vs. intratracheal administration), and DNA adducts were analyzed in different ways (TLC vs. HPLC 32P-postlabeling), but whether these or other factors account for the difference in detection of 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adducts between the two studies is unclear, and will require further investigation.
p4297
aVPreviously we found that 3-NBA characteristic DNA adducts were detectable by TLC 32P-postlabeling independently of the route of administration (oral, intraperitoneal, and intratracheal treatment), although DNA binding varied in different tissues (Arlt et al., 2001a, 2003b; Bieler et al., 2005).
p4298
aVMoreover, for 3-NBA the same characteristic DNA adducts were observed by HPLC 32P-postlabeling using different routes of administration (Nagy et al., 2005a, 2006), although TLC 32P-postlabeling seems to be more sensitive (Bieler et al., 2007).
p4299
aVSince DNA adducts were observed in vivo for 3-NBA under the same experimental conditions in the present study it seems that, similar to the observations made in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells described above, 2-NBA is also a poorer substrate for nitroreductases in vivo, at least in Wistar rats.
p4300
aVFurthermore, although we detected DNA adduct formation in rats treated with N-OH-2-ABA, DNA binding was much lower than that of N-OH-3-ABA, suggesting that N-OH-2-ABA may also be a poorer substrate for NATs and SULTs in vivo in rats, and/or is readily metabolized to 2-ABA, a possible detoxification pathway.
p4301
aVPhysicochemical values have been used to estimate structure-related biological activities such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of different isomeric compounds (Borosky, 2007; Hatch et al., 2001).
p4302
aVUsing a semiempirical quantum mechanical approach a recent study indicated that the mutagenicity of mono-nitrated benzanthrones, including 1-, 2-, 3-, 9-, and 11-NBA, depends on the reduction potential and geometry of the nitro group attached to benzanthrone, although the differences in particular for 2- and 3-NBA were small (Takamura-Enya et al., 2006).
p4303
aVIt is also noteworthy that no differences in hydrophobicity were observed among these NBA isomers, indicating that penetration into cell membranes is expected to be similar, and therefore would not be a critical determinant for their mutagenicity or DNA adduct forming potential.
p4304
aVMetabolic activation of nitro-PAHs involves the formation of highly reactive arylnitrenium ions capable of reacting with DNA to form covalent DNA adducts.
p4305
aVThus, variations in the structures of the aryl moieties of 2- and 3-NBA may have profound effects on the rates of formation and/or the reactivity of their nitrenium ions (Ford and Herman, 1992) and, consequently, on their DNA adduct forming potential and mutagenicity.
p4306
aVDFT is a widely applicable and robust method to calculate thermochemical parameters and charge distribution in molecular systems (Borosky, 2007; Reynisson and Steenken, 2004).
p4307
aVRecently, it was shown that among a large group of aromatic and heterocyclic aromatic amines investigated, derivatives with the highest electron density on the exocyclic nitrogen, i.e., the most stable species, were the most mutagenic ones (Borosky, 2007).
p4308
aVUsing the DFT method we observed quite large differences in the energetics of the nitrenium ions derived from 2- and 3-NBA.
p4309
aVMoreover, we found that the 3-isomer delocalizes the positive charge more effectively than the 2-isomer.
p4310
aVThis could mean that the greater stability of the nitrenium ion of 3-NBA provides it with more time to reach the nucleus, react with DNA and form larger amounts of DNA adducts than the nitrenium ion of 2-NBA.
p4311
aVThe latter may react more efficiently with cellular macromolecules in the immediate vicinity of its site of formation in the cytoplasm.
p4312
aVHowever, other factors besides the stability of the nitrenium ions may play a role in determining the extent of DNA adduct formation.
p4313
aVIn summary, we found that 2-NBA is mutagenic in bacteria and mammalian short-term assays.
p4314
aVIn contrast to 3-NBA, 2-NBA formed DNA adducts only in some of the human cell lines studied, indicating that differences occur in the metabolic activation pathway of each isomers.
p4315
aVMoreover, DNA binding by 2-NBA was generally substantially lower than by 3-NBA.
p4316
aVIn contrast to a recent report we found no evidence of 2-NBA\u2013derived DNA adduct formation in vivo in rats at comparable doses, an observation which certainly requires further investigation.
p4317
aVUsing authentic 2-NBA\u2013DNA adduct standards in the future may be one step toward resolving these discrepancies.
p4318
aVStructural calculations showed that physiochemical properties, or more likely a combination of both physiochemical and enzymatic properties, related to 2- and 3-NBA activation may account for their large differences in mutagenicity and DNA adduct formation.
p4319
aVColorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy.
p4320
aVMost of the clinical data on CRC prevention have come from the use of aspirin.
p4321
aVBesides inhibition of cyclooxygenases, aspirin has a diversity of molecular effects that counteract colon carcinogenesis.
p4322
aVAspirin restrains cell proliferation by inducing a G1 arrest in colorectal cells.
p4323
aVTo determine which cell cycle checkpoint pathways are involved in this response, colorectal cell lines wild-type or defective for p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 were treated with aspirin or the anti-proliferative drug sulindac sulfide, then assayed for proliferative activity, for cell cycle progression and apoptosis, for the activation and phosphorylation of checkpoint components and for the transcriptional up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and Bax.
p4324
aVAspirin and sulindac sulfide induced a G1 arrest within 48 h.
p4325
aVWhile all cell lines responded in a comparable way to sulindac sulfide, the aspirin-induced G1 arrest was dependent on p21Waf1/Cip1\u2014as cells lacking the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor failed to show this arrest\u2014and on ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM)\u2014as the inhibitor caffeine abrogated the checkpoint.
p4326
aVMoreover, aspirin induced cell death mainly in cells expressing p53.
p4327
aVAspirin induced the phosphorylation of p53 at residue Ser15 within 8 h in a caffeine-dependent manner, and also caused the activation of checkpoint kinase 2 and the cleavage of caspase 7.
p4328
aVOur results suggest that aspirin induces a G1 arrest and apoptosis by activating p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 in an ATM-dependent way.
p4329
aVBy activating these checkpoint pathways, aspirin may restrain uncontrolled proliferation of colorectal cells, enhance their response to stresses such as DNA damage and promote entry of abnormal cells into apoptosis.
p4330
aVCancer chemoprevention is understood as the use of natural, synthetic or chemical agents to reverse, suppress or prevent carcinogenic progression to invasive cancer.
p4331
aVFindings from epidemiological and clinical studies as well as animal models of colon carcinogenesis imply that some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylate derivatives and inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 may be effective against the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) (1).
p4332
aVPharmacologically, NSAIDs inhibit COXs in various cell types and tissues.
p4333
aVCOX-2 inhibition is believed to underlie the chemopreventive effect of NSAIDs possibly through reducing cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis or modulating angiogenesis.
p4334
aVNSAIDs inhibit the proliferation rate, alter the cell cycle distribution and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines.
p4335
aVAmong the most studied agents of the COX-2 inhibitor group of compounds are aspirin and sulindac and derivatives (2,3).
p4336
aVSalicylates were shown to have a chemopreventive role in CRC through COX-independent mechanisms, such as inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) (4).
p4337
aVSimilar lines of research suggested that aspirin alters the expression of genes involved in mismatch repair and cell cycle progression (5).
p4338
aVAll these pieces of experimental evidence point to the interference of aspirin with cell cycle progression, although the biochemical pathways involved are still obscure.
p4339
aVTo maintain genome stability and monitor the structure of chromosomes, eukaryotic cells have evolved surveillance mechanisms called cell cycle checkpoints that block cell cycle progression at specific stages to allow the cell to recover from the impairment (6).
p4340
aVCheckpoint pathways comprise damage sensors, signal transducers and effectors.
p4341
aVAtaxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) are phosphatidylinositol-3-like kinases central to the DNA damage response, which can cause activation of checkpoints, DNA repair and apoptosis (7).
p4342
aVATM is the protein product of the gene mutated in the multisystem disorder ataxia-telangiectasia, which is characterized by neuronal degeneration, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition (8).
p4343
aVThe ATM pathway responds to the presence of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and can be activated during all phases of the cell cycle.
p4344
aVIn the absence of a checkpoint mechanism, premature progression through the cell cycle can be either lethal to the cell or result in oncogenic transformation.
p4345
aVA hallmark of the transformed state of tumor cells is incompetent checkpoint control, resulting in accumulation of mutations and genetic abnormalities (9).
p4346
aVWhen checkpoint control is compromised, initiation of S phase, or the onset of mitosis, occurs despite cellular damage, and the ensuing genetic instability may lead to the emergence of a malignant clone.
p4347
aVCells in which checkpoint control is disrupted are susceptible to the accumulation of additional genotoxic damage (10).
p4348
aVThe tumor suppressor protein p53 is the major known mediator of the checkpoint-induced arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
p4349
aVA variety of cellular stresses including DNA damage, hypoxia, nucleotide depletion, viral infection and cytokine-activated signaling pathways transiently stabilize the p53 protein, cause it to accumulate in the nucleus and activate it as a transcription factor (11).
p4350
aVP53 induces cell cycle arrest, through the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 (12), preventing the replication of damaged DNA.
p4351
aVAlternatively, p53 can promote apoptosis, mainly through Bax (13), which is important for eliminating defective cells.
p4352
aVMutations in the p53 gene occur in half of all human cancers, and regulation of the protein is defective in a variety of others (14).
p4353
aVStabilization of p53 in response to ionizing radiation and ultraviolet light is dependent on the ATM and ATR kinases, respectively (15).
p4354
aVATM is required for homologous recombination and cell cycle checkpoint activation after DNA damage (16).
p4355
aVIn addition, germline mutations of ATM lead to radiation hypersensitivity, growth retardation, immunodeficiency and greatly increased cancer risk (17).
p4356
aVUpon activation, ATM undergoes Ser1981 auto-phosphorylation and dimer separation (18).
p4357
aVAs a protein kinase, ATM functions by phosphorylating and activating a number of DNA repair and checkpoint proteins including p53 and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), and it has been established previously that ATM is required to activate a p53-dependent cell cycle G1 arrest upon DNA damage (19).
p4358
aVATM and ATR both directly phosphorylate p53 in vivo on Ser15 and Ser37 causing stabilization (20).
p4359
aVThe ATM and ATR substrate Chk2 phosphorylates p53 on Ser20, which regulates the binding to and degradation by Mdm2 and thereby stabilizes p53 (21).
p4360
aVOur present study is focused on understanding the mechanisms by which aspirin exerts its control over cell cycle progression and activates cellular checkpoints in colon cells.
p4361
aVWe show that aspirin induces a caffeine-sensitive G1 arrest, which is dependent on p21Waf1/Cip1 and ATM, and cell death in cells expressing p53.
p4362
aVMoreover, aspirin leads to phosphorylation of p53, \u03b3-H2AX and Chk2 in an ATM-dependent manner, indicating that it activates a cellular checkpoint pathway including these proteins.

aVWhen needed, HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells were transfected with 0.5\u20131 \u03bcg pcDNA-p53 coding for full-length p53 (24) or empty vector (Invitrogen).
p4374
aVpGL3-p21-luciferase and pGL3-Bax-Luciferase constructs were a gift from M.Oren (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) and they are described elsewhere in the text.

aVAll transfections were performed with the Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
p4376
aVCells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 5000 cells per well in medium.
p4377
aVTwenty-four hours later, cells were treated with aspirin (0\u201310 mM) or sulindac sulfide (0\u2013400 \u03bcM); untreated cells served as controls.
p4378
aVAfter treatment for 48 or 72 h, cell proliferation was assayed using methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide salt (MTT) as described previously (23).
p4379
aVCells treated with aspirin or sulindac sulfide for 48\u201372 h were harvested and the cell cycle distribution was analyzed as described previously (23).
p4380
aVCells were seeded in a 6-well culture plate at a density of 105 cells per well and transfected with 0.5 \u03bcg of either pGL3-Basic-Vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany; containing no promoter upstream of the Luciferase gene), pGL3-Control-Vector (Promega; containing the SV40 constitutive promoter upstream of the Luciferase gene) or pGL3-based plasmids upstream of the Luciferase coding sequence ([containing the promoters of the p21Waf1/Cip1 or the Bax genes] pGL3-p21-Luciferase and pGL3-Bax-Luciferase, respectively).
p4381
aVMore in details, pGL3-p21-Luciferase contains a 2.5 Kb stretch, corresponding to the promoter sequence of the human p21Waf1/Cip1 gene digested with HindIII and subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic-Vector and containing a tandem binding site for p53 (12); pGL3-Bax-Luciferase Bax luciferase containing the proximal promoter region of the human bax gene fragment -715/-317 from the Bax gene promoter subcloned into BglII\u2013HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic-Vector (25,26).
p4382
aVTransfected cells were treated with aspirin (10 mM) for 24 h. Cells were harvested in 1× Reagent Lysis Buffer (Promega) and the luciferase activity of the lysates was measured using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions.
p4383
aVBriefly, 50 mg of whole-cell lysates were mixed with 100 ml of reconstituted Luciferase Assay Substrate, and the light emitted was measured with a Lumat LB 9507 (Berthold, Vienna, Austria) tube luminometer.
p4384
aVRelative units of light were defined by the formula: relative units of light = specific units of light/(control vector units \u2212 basic vector units).
p4385
aVProliferation inhibition by MTT was compared between different cell lines using the Student's T-test at a representative concentration.
p4386
aVA P value below 0.05 was considered significant.
p4387
aVIn order to investigate the proliferation inhibitory effect of aspirin on colon cells,
p4388
aVHCT116 and HT29 were treated with aspirin (0\u201310 mM) for 72 h. These cell lines have been chosen on the basis of their different expression of COX-2, p53 and downstream genes (Figure S1, supplementary data are available at Carcinogenesis online).
p4389
aVIn fact, HCT116 do not express COX-2 (27), but bear a wild-type form of p53, whereas HT29 express COX-2 but have a mutated p53 (p53R273H).

aVCellular proliferation was assessed by MTT assay.

aVHowever, 72 h after treatment, the number of viable cells was higher in the HT29 cell line than in HCT116 (e.g.
p4393
aVat 0.62 mM aspirin: 68.2 ± 4.2 versus 45.6 ± 1.6% of control, P &lt; 0.0001 or at 2.5 mM: 35.6 ± 1.7 versus 23.6 ± 1.0; P &lt; 0.0001).
p4394
aVAs HT29 cells express a mutant form of p53 (p53R273H), we wished to investigate whether the difference in response of the 2 cell lines was due to an active p53 pathway.
p4395
aVThe p53-null HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 is a cell line isogenetic to the wild-type clone HCT116 created by targeted homologous recombination [Figure S1 and (28)].
p4396
aVHCT116 cells and HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 were incubated in the presence of 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 mM aspirin for 72 h (Figure 1B).
p4397
aVWe found that HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells were more resistant to aspirin treatment than HCT116 (p53-wt) (e.g.
p4398
aVat 2.5 mM aspirin 47.6 ± 2.1 versus 31.9 ± 2.4% of control; P &lt; 0.0001); moreover, re-introduction of p53 into HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells via transient transfection (Figure 1D) increased their sensitivity to aspirin treatment to an extent similar to that of HCT116 cells (Figure 1C).
p4399
aVAll these results point to a role of p53 for aspirin-mediated changes in proliferation and/or cell death.
p4400
aVThe results shown in Figure 1A and B have been normalized to the respective untreated control to account for the differences in the growth rate of the various colon cell lines.
p4401
aVThe corresponding non-normalized graphs, as well as the one in Figure 2B described here below, are shown as supplementary data are available at Carcinogenesis online (Figure S2A\u2013D).
p4402
aVIt has been reported previously that aspirin causes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis in a number of cell lines (5,29).
p4403
aVIn order to establish whether the reduction in proliferation of colon cells was due to aspirin-induced changes in cell cycle progression,
p4404
aVHT29, HCT116 and HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 were cultured in the presence of 2.5, 5, or 10 mM aspirin for 48 h and the cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry.
p4405
aVUpon treatment with 5 mM aspirin (Figure 2A), HCT116 cells arrested in G1 almost completely (82% of the cell population) within 48 h, whereas HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 and HT29 cells showed a less complete arrest (62 and 71%, respectively).
p4406
aVHigh aspirin concentrations (10 mM) affected cell survival in HCT116 and HT29 but less so in HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells; the latter cell line arrested in both G1 and G2 (Figure 2A).
p4407
aVThe observed increase in the G1 population parallels the changes in the MTT experiments with higher aspirin sensitivity displayed in HCT116 than in HT29 or HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells.
p4408
aVThe strongest effect on G1 arrest was observed at 5 mM aspirin.
p4409
aVAs a control, cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM sulindac sulfide (at its IC50 concentration, as assessed by MTT assay on HCT116 cells) for 48 h (Figure 2B),
p4410
aVwhich has been described to reduce the proliferation rate of HT-29 cells by inducing G1 arrest (30).
p4411
aVWe found that all three cell lines responded to sulindac sulfide to a similar extent (G1 population: HCT116 65%, HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 59% and HT29 68%).
p4412
aVThese results suggest that p53 only partially controls the aspirin-mediated (but not sulindac sulfide mediated) G1 arrest and at higher concentrations the aspirin-induced cell death.
p4413
aVHowever, cells lacking functional p53 were still able to activate checkpoint responses, which led to cell cycle arrest more in G1 and G2 and, to a lower extent, to apoptosis.
p4414
aVThe tumor suppressor p53 is known to play a key role in cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis in response to various stresses such as DNA-damaging agents and anticancer drugs.
p4415
aVPhosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 by the phosphatidylinositol-3-like kinases ATM and ATR triggers post-translational modifications that contribute to p53 stabilization.
p4416
aVThus, we examined whether p53 protein levels and phosphorylation were altered by aspirin treatment in our system.
p4417
aVHT29 and HCT116 cells were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5 or 10 mM aspirin for 8 h.
p4418
aVAnalysis of total cell lysates indicated a concentration-dependent increase in phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 in both cell lines but not of total protein levels (Figure 3A, top panels).
p4419
aVOne of the major phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases that target p53 N-terminal residue Ser15 for phosphorylation is ATM (31).
p4420
aVHCT116 and HT29 cells were treated with 5 or 10 mM aspirin for 8 h, in the presence or absence of caffeine,
p4421
aVa known inhibitor of the ATM and ATR pathways (32).
p4422
aVPhosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 decreased in a caffeine-dependent manner in HCT116 cells (Figure 3A, bottom panels) and in HT29 cells (data not shown),
p4423
aVsuggesting a role for ATM or ATR in the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15.
p4424
aVAs we did not see activated ATR (i.e.
p4425
aVchromatin-bound ATR; data not shown), we investigated the activation status of the ATM kinase by assessing its auto-phosphorylation at Ser1981 upon exposure to aspirin.
p4426
aVA time course experiment revealed that ATM Ser1981 was phosphorylated within 2\u20134 h, with a peak at 8 h in HCT116 cells (Figure 3B).
p4427
aVThe kinetic of ATM activation paralleled that of the phosphorylation of the histone \u03b3-H2AX at Ser139 (Figure 3B), a site targeted by ATM (19).
p4428
aVAs our data point to an activation of ATM by aspirin, we investigated further ATM substrates such as Chk2.
p4429
aVChk2 kinase plays a central role in modulating the cellular response to DNA damage, resulting in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis depending on the severity of the DNA damage and the cellular context.
p4430
aVChk2 is activated by phosphorylation on residue Thr68 by the kinase ATM (33).
p4431
aVWe treated HCT116, HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 and HT29 cells with 10 mM aspirin for 2, 4, 8 and 24 h.
p4432
aVAlthough the kinase total levels were similar in all cell lines, Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr68 was detectable in p53-null cells as early as 2 h, whereas it was a much later event in the p53-wt cells (Figure 3C).
p4433
aVIn this time course experiment, p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 was visible within 8 h of aspirin treatment in HCT116 and HT29 cells and correlated with ATM activation.
p4434
aVAs expected, no p53 signal was detected in the HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells.
p4435
aVThe timing of phosphorylation of Chk2 and p53 is consistent with the activation of the ATM pathway.
p4436
aVIn order to further confirm the role of the checkpoint kinase ATM in the aspirin-induced responses,
p4437
aVwe repeated the treatment of colon cells HCT116 in the presence of caffeine,
p4438
aVknown to abrogate cellular checkpoint responses dependent on ATM and ATR (7).
p4439
aVHCT116 cells were exposed to 5 or 10 mM aspirin for 48 h and 5 mM caffeine was added either at the same time as aspirin or 24 h later (Figure 3D).
p4440
aVAnalysis of cell cycle progression revealed that caffeine was able to prevent the activation of the aspirin-dependent G1 arrest and apoptosis; moreover, this effect was time dependent, as exposure to caffeine for 24 h only partially reversed both responses.
p4441
aVTaken together, all these results indicate that the ATM checkpoint kinase mediates the effect of aspirin inhibition of proliferation in colon cells.
p4442
aVThe cleavage and activation of caspase 7 is a well-established marker for the onset of apoptosis (34).
p4443
aVWhen we tested whether the caspase cascade was activated in colorectal cell lines, we found that aspirin increased cleavage of caspase 7 (Figure 3C).
p4444
aVActivation of p53 is known to mediate apoptosis, which has been observed upon treatment with aspirin or NSAIDs (5).
p4445
aVCaspase
p4446
aVAND
p4447
aV7 cleavage was more pronounced in the p53-wt cells and happened at an earlier time point (2 h).
p4448
aVIn the p53-mutant HT29 cells, the signal of caspase 7 cleavage was delayed but strong after 24 h, consistent with the pronounced cell death described earlier (Figure 2A), whereas in the HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells, caspase 7 cleavage was much weaker (also consistent with the lower extent of cell death shown in Figure 2A).
p4449
aVThese data suggest that aspirin induces apoptosis mostly in cells expressing either wild-type or mutant p53.
p4450
aVHowever, a p53-independent mechanism must be responsible for the cleavage of caspase 7 (although weak) and cell death in p53-null cells.
p4451
aVIt is well established that p53 mediates cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase through transcriptional activation of p21Waf1/Cip1, an inhibitor of the CDKs 2, 3, 4 and 6.
p4452
aVIn HCT116 cells, an increase in p21Waf1/Cip1 levels was observed after 16 h treatment with aspirin (Figure 3C).
p4453
aVHowever, the levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 also increased in p53-null and mutant cells, which correlated with increased phosphorylation levels of Chk2 (Figures 3C),
p4454
aVindicating the presence of a p53-independent mechanism for p21Waf1/Cip1 up-regulation in these cells.
p4455
aVA regulation of p21 levels by aspirin has been reported previously in HT29 cells, which express the transcriptionally inactive p53R273H mutant (35).
p4456
aVIn order to further investigate the role of p21Waf1/Cip1, we extended our study to HCT116p21\u2212/\u2212 cells, in which the expression of the p21Waf1/Cip1 gene has been disrupted [Figure S1, supplementary data are available at Carcinogenesis online; (22)].
p4457
aVHCT116p21\u2212/\u2212 cells were even more resistant to aspirin than HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells (e.g.
p4458
aVat 2.5 mM aspirin 76.8 ± 10.3 versus 47.6 ± 2.1% of control; P &lt; 0.0001; Figure 4A).
p4459
aVMoreover, 48 h of treatment with aspirin failed to induce a G1 arrest (Figure 4C),
p4460
aVwhich was clearly visible in the parental cell line HCT116 (Figure 4B).
p4461
aVInstead, even low concentrations of aspirin (above 1.25 mM) induced cell death, suggesting that this apoptotic response is not dependent on p21Waf1/Cip1 but also that the disruption of p21Waf1/Cip1 could somehow sensitize the cell to apoptotic stimuli (36).
p4462
aVIn order to quantify the effect of aspirin on p21Waf1/Cip1 expression, we transfected HCT116, HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212, HCT116p21\u2212/\u2212 and HT29 cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid bearing the p21Waf1/Cip1 minimal promoter upstream of the Luciferase gene.
p4463
aVUpon aspirin treatment, all cell lines showed an increased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1-driven luciferase activity (Figure 4D),
p4464
aVconsistent with our western blot findings (Figure 3C).
p4465
aVIn an analogous experiment with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the Bax promoter,
p4466
aVonly HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 failed to induce Bax-driven luciferase expression (Figure 4D).
p4467
aVFurthermore, when p53 was reintroduced into the HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells via transient transfection, they re-gained the ability to up-regulate the expression of Bax upon treatment with aspirin (Figure 3D), suggesting that the induction of Bax, the major mediator of apoptosis upon DNA damage, is dependent on p53 expression (37).
p4468
aVActivation and phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinases ATM and Chk2, as well as p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, are normally associated with cellular responses to DNA damage and/or DSBs.
p4469
aVMoreover, the appearance of foci of \u03b3-H2AX phosphorylation is characteristic of DNA damage and repair.
p4470
aVIn order to verify that aspirin did not cause permanent damage to cells,
p4471
aVwe exposed HCT116 cells to 5 or 10 mM aspirin for 48 h followed by culturing these cells under normal medium conditions for further 48 h (Figure 5).
p4472
aVThe G1 arrest and other cellular changes (which might mediate a G1/S checkpoint response) were fully reversible, as the profiles of the cell samples were very similar to those of untreated cells.
p4473
aVIn addition, after treatment with 10 mM aspirin, the remaining viable cells seemed to regain a normal proliferation profile.
p4474
aVThis suggests that aspirin does not produce permanent cell damage.
p4475
aVThere is growing experimental and clinical evidence indicating that aspirin has cancer-preventive activity, in particular, in the colon (1).
p4476
aVA possible mechanism for the antitumor properties of aspirin has been ascribed to its direct inhibition of COX-2 in colorectal cells (38).
p4477
aVHowever, the anti-proliferative activity of aspirin does not correlate exclusively with its COX-2 inhibitory activity, as aspirin can induce apoptosis in cells lacking COX-2 expression [see Figure S1, supplementary data are available at Carcinogenesis online and (39)].
p4478
aVAlthough we have not tested the inhibition of prostaglandin production in our system, we do not believe that the observed effects may depend on the regulation of the prostaglandin pathway alone, as the latter is likely to be similarly regulated in the nearly isogenic cell lines HCT116, HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 and HCT116p21\u2212/\u2212, all negative for COX-2 (Figure S1, supplementary data are available at Carcinogenesis online), whereas these cell lines show distinctively different responses to aspirin.
p4479
aVPredisposition to cancer and radiosensitivity observed in Ataxia Telengectasia patients has been linked to chromosomal instability, abnormalities in genetic recombination and defective signaling to programmed cell death and several cell cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage.
p4480
aVATM mutations (generally null alleles that truncate or destabilize the protein) are involved in the development of sporadic human cancers such as leukemia (40); loss of heterozygosity at the ATM locus was also found in about 30% of colorectal carcinomas (41).
p4481
aVThese observations predicted that the ATM gene encodes a protein, which plays a crucial role in sensing DNA damage and transducing signals that promote apoptosis (42).
p4482
aVFurthermore, it was reported that ATM might have a role in activating defence mechanisms against oxidative stress (43).
p4483
aVIn a recently published study, the mechanisms by which the aspirin-related compound nitric oxide (NO)-releasing aspirin induced apoptosis in the human B-lymphoblastoid TK6 cell line were investigated.
p4484
aVThe authors observed that treatment with NO-aspirin led to DNA damage, histone H2AX phosphorylation on Ser 139 and ATM phosphorylation on Ser 1981, effects that were dependent on the NO-moiety of the compound.
p4485
aVIn fact, these responses were attenuated by the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetyl-L-cystein, suggesting that the DNA damage induced by NO-aspirin is caused by oxidative stress.
p4486
aVIn our system, aspirin did not affect the production of reactive oxygen species by activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (Supplementary Figure S4, supplementary data are available at Carcinogenesis online), as measured by a lucigenin-based method, indicating that oxidative stress is not the mediator of the observed response to aspirin.
p4487
aVWe reported the activation of the ATM-dependent checkpoint independently of oxidative stress and of aspirin anti-inflammatory properties.
p4488
aVOur evidence for ATM being involved in the checkpoint response mediated by aspirin includes auto-phosphorylation of ATM and of its targets \u03b3-H2AX, p53 and Chk2 (Figure 3A\u2013C) and the ability of the ATM inhibitor caffeine to revert the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Figure 3D).
p4489
aVOncogenes and tumor suppressor genes play essential roles in colorectal carcinogenesis.
p4490
aVIn cancer cells defective for p53, the tumor suppressor is no longer able to control cell proliferation and is inefficient in preventing the emergence of genetically unstable cell populations.
p4491
aVThe most common changes of p53 in cancer tissues are missense mutations and loss of heterozygosity, leading to a \u2018loss-of-function\u2019 phenotype.
p4492
aVSuch alterations are found in many human cancers, including colon carcinomas (incidence of 70\u201375% of cases) (44).
p4493
aVPhosphorylation at different residues in p53 has been shown to occur after cells were exposed to DNA-damaging agents.
p4494
aVUpon cellular stress, p53 is phosphorylated by kinases targeting its C-terminal and N-terminal domains, which results in the activation of its transcriptional activity (24,45).
p4495
aVSerine 15 is a known target of ATM and becomes phosphorylated after DNA damage (46).
p4496
aVIn our study, p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 was increased following aspirin treatment and was sensitive to the ATM and ATR inhibitor caffeine (Figure 3A).
p4497
aVCaffeine was also able to reverse the cellular responses of G1 arrest and apoptosis induced by aspirin in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3D).
p4498
aVMoreover, we detected ATM auto-phosphorylation, as well as phosphorylation of \u03b3-H2AX and Chk2 at ATM-targeted sites (Figure 3B and C).
p4499
aVPhosphorylation of \u03b3-H2AX by ATM facilitates the formation of foci to which proteins known as mediators of the DNA damage checkpoint, such as MDC1 and BRCA1, are recruited (19).
p4500
aVThe assembly of these factors near a DSB coincides with checkpoint activation and recruitment of repair proteins.
p4501
aVTherefore, the presence of \u03b3-H2AX phosphorylation suggests that aspirin generates signaling resembling that of DSB-induced checkpoint.
p4502
aVHowever, the exact nature of the molecular signal that activates this checkpoint remains to be determined.
p4503
aVOur results show that aspirin induces a G1 cell cycle arrest.
p4504
aVAn aspirin-dependent G1 arrest had been observed before in several tumor cell lines (5,29).
p4505
aVA recent study (47) investigated the effects of aspirin on the NF-\u03baB signaling in HCT116-derived cell lines, with regards to NF-\u03baB translocation and induction of apoptosis.
p4506
aVThe authors found no effect of either p53 or hMLH1 in the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway by aspirin.
p4507
aVA close analysis of some of their findings, though, also shows differences in the cell viability and response to apoptosis between HCT116 and HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells, which match our results.
p4508
aVWe therefore suggest that p53 has only a minor role in the cell cycle response to aspirin, as cells not expressing p53 still undergo a good G1 arrest.
p4509
aVIt has also been reported that the tumor suppressor p53 may up-regulate COX-2 expression and that COX-2 in turn inhibits p53-dependent transcription (48).
p4510
aVHowever, as we showed, and others reported (49) that HCT116 cells do not express COX-2, this is unlikely to be the molecular mechanism behind the response to aspirin.
p4511
aVIn our study, we pinpoint the CDK inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 as the major mediator for the aspirin-dependent G1/S checkpoint.
p4512
aVA recent microarray-based study by Hardwick et al.
p4513
aV(35) reported p21Waf1/Cip1 to be up-regulated, at both gene and protein levels, in HT29 cells treated with 5 mM aspirin.
p4514
aVConsistently with these findings, p21Waf1/Cip1 were also raised in our system in all cells tested, including HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 and HT29 cells (Figure 3C; Figure S1, supplementary data are available at Carcinogenesis online).
p4515
aVIn HT29 cells, p53 is transcriptionally inactive, bearing a mutation (R273H) within its DNA-binding domain, whereas HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 do not express p53; therefore, the increase in the p21Waf1/Cip1 expression upon aspirin treatment is likely to be p53 independent.
p4516
aVThe checkpoint kinase Chk2 has also been described to induce p21Waf1/Cip1-dependent senescence (50).
p4517
aVSome other p53-independent mechanisms of increasing p21Waf1/Cip1 expression have been reported (51).
p4518
aVAmong these, the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1, which is often mutated in sporadic cancers (such as CRC), has been recently linked to p21Waf1/Cip1 expression (52).
p4519
aVGermline mutations of LKB1 lead to Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome, which is characterized by gastrointestinal polyps and cancer in different organs and to loss of LKB1 kinase activity (53).
p4520
aVIt would be interesting to investigate whether aspirin has any effect on the activation of the LKB1 kinase pathway and if it is useful in patients with Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome.
p4521
aVInterestingly, we observed cell death (Figure 2A), caspase 7 cleavage (Figure 3C) and Bax-driven luciferase expression (Figure 4D) not only in wild-type but also in cells expressing p53R273H (but not in p53-null cells), suggesting that the mutant p53 is able to induce Bax expression, activation of the caspase cleavage cascade and thereby apoptosis.
p4522
aVHT29 cells have been described previously as being sensitive to aspirin- or other drug-induced apoptosis (54).
p4523
aVIt was shown that elevated levels of p53R273H, although considered to be transcriptionally inactive, rendered transformed human cells susceptible to apoptosis through Bax (55).
p4524
aVOur luciferase reporter assay indicates that p53R273H is able to bind to the Bax promoter, which might suggest that aspirin maintains chemopreventive activities in tumors in which mutations of p53 have occurred.
p4525
aVWe could speculate that this mechanism helps preventing clonal expansion of p53-mutated cells upon aspirin treatment.
p4526
aVUpon treatment with 10 mM aspirin, HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells accumulate in G1 and G2, indicating that both checkpoints have been activated (Figure 2A, middle panels).
p4527
aVIn a previous study with p53-deficient cells, a bypass of the G1/S checkpoint and an increase in G2/M arrest was described in response to DNA damage (56).
p4528
aVChk2 kinase, which mediates the cellular responses to DNA damage downstream of ATM (33), is known to induce arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting the dual phosphatase Cdc25C and thus blocking activation of the CDC2\u2013cyclin B complex and entry into mitosis (32).
p4529
aVIn HCT116p53\u2212/\u2212 cells, a particularly strong phosphorylation of Chk2 was also observed (Figure 3C).
p4530
aVThese data lead us to hypothesize that, at high concentrations of aspirin, Chk2-dependent G2/M checkpoint pathways are activated in p53-deficient cells along a weak apoptotic response.
p4531
aVOur results taken together suggest a novel ATM-dependent mechanism of action for aspirin in the chemoprevention of colon cancer.
p4532
aVAspirin is mainly operating through the p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway for its anti-proliferative activity in a p53-independent manner.
p4533
aVHowever, cells not expressing p53 are more resistant to aspirin-induced cell death suggesting that p53 has an important role in the activation of the apoptotic response in colon cells.
p4534
aVDownstream effects of the ATM activation induce cleavage of caspase 7 and up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and Bax; the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 upon aspirin treatment is transcriptionally regulated in the absence of p53 and may be dependent upon additional factors (Figure 6).
p4535
aVIt has been suggested that ATM is recruited to the site of DNA damage.
p4536
aVATM can directly bind to and phosphorylate proteins involved in DNA repair, such as c-Abl, Brca1, Nbs1 and replication protein A (57).
p4537
aVWe speculate that, by activating the G1/S checkpoint, aspirin increases the opportunity of colorectal cells to repair DNA damage before replication or to induce apoptosis both of which may contribute to maintaining the integrity of genomic DNA.
p4538
aVSensor protein complexes scan the DNA for abnormalities and translate these stimuli into activating signals for downstream target proteins, such as the ATM kinase.
p4539
aVHowever, despite the numerous studies on molecular components of checkpoints, both the identities of these sensors and their mechanisms of action are still unclear.
p4540
aVIt seems possible that aspirin interferes with such sensors upstream of ATM.
p4541
aVThe identification of additional aspirin targets (besides COX-2) will help in the understanding of its antitumor effects and in the design of novel chemopreventive agents.
p4542
aVAspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed to salicylate and other salicylic metabolites both in vivo (58) and in vitro (59).
p4543
aVThe clinical relevance of our data is strengthened by the fact that these concentrations of aspirin correspond to salicylate levels measured in the plasma of human patients, as well as to the therapeutic concentrations used in the treatment of arthritis (60).
p4544
aVComparisons between concentrations used on cell cultures and plasma levels, however, are somewhat artificial, because of the inability to accurately mimic in vivo metabolism and tissue concentration of aspirin in epithelial or tumor cells.
p4545
aVIn addition, the duration of drug exposure in cell culture is minimal when compared with long-term use for the reason of chemoprevention.
p4546
aVIn our study, the effects of aspirin on apoptosis and cell cycle were greatest when the cells were treated with a single dose of 5\u201310 mM aspirin for 48 h. A dose-dependent response in G1 arrest was already visible at lower concentrations in HCT116 cells (1.25\u20132.5 mM).
p4547
aVTherefore, although the concentrations of aspirin used in our study may seem rather high, they are within the range that has been used in culture previously (1\u201320 mM) (4,5,61), and the effects observed may accurately reflect a biomechanism of repetitive dosing for long-term chemoprevention.
p4548
aVRegional specific relationships between oxidative stress and the development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)\u2212positive or GST-P\u2212negative lesions in rats, induced by fenofibrate (FF), a peroxisome proliferator, were examined using a two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model in F344 rats.
p4549
aVAnimals were initiated with a single ip injection of 200 mg/kg N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and from 2 weeks later were fed a diet containing 3000 or ppm FF for 28 weeks.
p4550
aVAnimals were subjected to a two-third partial hepatectomy at week 3 and sacrificed at week 28.
p4551
aVThe development of hepatocellular proliferative lesions, which were mainly attributed to GST-P\u2212negative lesions, was significantly increased in the FF-treated groups.
p4552
aVImmunohistochemically, GST-P\u2212positive lesions were devoid of intracytoplasmic nuclear factor-erythroid 2\u2212related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, whereas GST-P\u2212negative lesions expressed higher levels of cytoplasmic Nrf2.
p4553
aVOn the other hand, nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 was observed in some cells of GST-P\u2212positive lesions that were negative for Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and in GST-P\u2212negative lesions of the DEN-FF group that were positive for Nrf2 in the cytoplasm.
p4554
aVThe mRNA expression levels of Gpx2 or Gsta2, Nrf2-inducible enzymes, were increased in GST-P\u2212positive tumors or GST-P\u2212positive lesions, respectively.
p4555
aVThese results suggest that the activation of Nrf2, due to nuclear translocation, occurs in the GST-P\u2212positive lesions.
p4556
aVIn addition, the development of continuous oxidative stress was identified by mRNA expression analyses as well as by measurements of GST activity and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine.
p4557
aVThese results suggest that the relative inhibition of nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in GST-P\u2212negative lesions aggravated the condition of oxidative stress in the liver of rats given FF, resulting in enhanced tumor promotion in FF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
p4558
aVFenofibrate (FF), a member of the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs, has been extensively used in many countries to treat hypertriglyceridemia and mixed hyperlipidemia (Staels et al., 1998).
p4559
aVIt belongs to the broad class of chemicals known as peroxisome proliferators (PPs), which act through the peroxisome proliferator\u2212activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1).
p4560
aVInformation about FF has been released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which shows FF to be carcinogenic to rodent species when administered at high doses; 200 mg/kg administered to rats for 24 months or to mice for 21 months increased the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in both sexes.
p4561
aVHowever, FF showed no mutagenic potential in the following four tests: Ames, mouse lymphoma, chromosomal aberration, and unscheduled DNA synthesis.
p4562
aVTherefore, FF is regarded as a nongenotoxic carcinogen, and attention has focused on possible indirect mechanisms to explain PP-induced hepatocarcinogenesis (Rao and Reddy, 1987).
p4563
aVThe activation of PPAR\u03b1 induces cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis (Boitier et al., 2003; Peters et al., 1997).
p4564
aVPPAR\u03b1 also mediates the hepatocarcinogenic potential of PPs in rodents since PPAR\u03b1 knockout mice are nonresponsive and do not develop hepatocarcinogenesis after long-term treatment with PPs (Gonzalez, 1997; Peters et al., 1997).
p4565
aVIn addition, as an indirect mechanism, it is considered that oxidative stress is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis (Klaunig and Kamendulis, 2004).
p4566
aVThis hypothesis is based on the observation that PPAR\u03b1 agonists markedly induce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-generating enzymes, such as acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) oxidase and cytochrome P450 4A, resulting in increased levels of H2O2, leading to lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage (Seo et al., 2004).
p4567
aVWe have previously identified changes that indicate DNA damage, such as elevations of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and expression of DNA repair enzymes, in the liver of rats in the early stage of repeated FF toxicity and also during preneoplastic foci formation, a stage which is linked to oxidative stress (Nishimura et al., 2007, 2008).
p4568
aVGlutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) is a reliable marker for preneoplastic lesions in rats by the great majority of carcinogens (Sato, 1989), while it is well known that preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the liver induced by PPAR\u03b1 agonists are not always stained with GST-P (Rao et al., 1988).
p4569
aVThe region-specific differences in expression of genes involved in oxidative stress between GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative proliferative lesions remain unclear.
p4570
aVNuclear factor-erythroid 2\u2212related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the inducible expression of genes encoding detoxifying systems, including phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (Jaiswal, 2004).
p4571
aVThese defensive enzymes are coordinately induced through the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) and are tightly regulated by Nrf2 (Nguyen et al., 2003).
p4572
aVThe roles of Nrf2 in the regulation of expression of many detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes under conditions of oxidative stress have been verified in experiments using Nrf2-deficient mice.
p4573
aVThe expression of these enzymes is dramatically attenuated, and these mice are much more susceptible to carcinogen-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis (Enomoto et al., 2001; Ramos-Gomez et al., 2001).
p4574
aVWith regard to the relationship between PPAR\u03b1 and Nrf2, Anderson et al.
p4575
aV(2004) confirmed that Wy-14643, a PPAR\u03b1 agonist, alters the expression of stress-inducible genes by an Nrf2-independent mechanism.
p4576
aVHowever, it is not clear whether or not Nrf2 is involved in the development of hepatocellular preneoplastic foci and tumors induced by PPAR\u03b1 agonists.
p4577
aVThus, in the present study, we focused on hepatocellular proliferative lesions consisting of GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative lesions.
p4578
aVWe investigated region-specific gene expression analyses using laser microdissection (LMD) and protein localization using immunohistochemistry to reveal the relationship between oxidative stress and the development of hepatocellular proliferative lesions.
p4579
aVTo rapidly induce large numbers of these lesions, we induced an N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)\u2212initiated hepatocarcinogenesis model in rats, which had undergone partial hepatectomy (PH).
p4580
aVWe also performed gene expression analysis and measured total GST activity and 8-OHdG levels using whole liver tissues to estimate cellular redox status.

p4612
aVIn addition, the Schmorl reaction was conducted to detect lipofuscin deposition.
p4613
aVAfter deparaffinization (and target retrieval by autoclaving in citrate buffer in the case of Nrf2 and by a hot water bath [95°C] in the case of Gpx2) and incubation in 0.3% H2O2 and normal serum, sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with a rabbit polyclonal anti-rat GST-P antibody (MBL; 1:1000, 4°C, overnight) and a goat polyclonal anti-Gpx2 antibody (Abcam; 1:100, 4°C, overnight) using a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit and DAB.

p4615
aVThe numbers and areas of GST-P\u2212positive foci and the number of Nrf2-positive foci &gt; 0.2 mm in diameter, and total areas of liver sections, were measured with the use of WinRoof software (Mitani Corp., Fukui, Japan).
p4616
aVThe cytosolic fraction was prepared from liver tissue by homogenization in ice-cold 1.15% KCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.1mM dithiothreitol, 0.1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerin and centrifugation at 700 × g, 4°C, for 10 min.

p4625
aVThe DNA was digested to deoxynucleotides using nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase, and the level of 8-OHdG (8-OHdG/105 deoxyguanosine) was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography using an electrochemical detection system (Coulochem II; ESA Biosciences, Inc., MA).

p4628
aVTaking into account our previous reports (Nishimura et al., 2007, 2008), we assessed gene expression of the following 14 genes: acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Aco), cytochrome P450, 4A1 (Cyp4a1), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Apex1), X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 5 (Xrcc5), glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2), DNA damage\u2212inducible 45 alpha (Gadd45a), MutL homolog 1 (Mlh1), nibrin (Nbn), 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg1), UDP glycosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A6 (Ugt1a6), glutathione S-transferase Yc2 subunit (Yc2), glutathione S-transferase, alpha type2 (Gsta2), glutathione S-transferase, mu type 2 (Gstm2), and glutathione S-transferase, mu type 3 (Gstm3).

p4632
aVMethacarn solution, consisting of 60% (vol/vol) absolute methanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% glacial acetic acid was used as fixative for LMD, based on the report of Shibutani et al.
p4633
aV(2000).
p4634
aVMethacarn solution was freshly prepared before fixation and stored at 4°C until use.
p4635
aVAt necropsy, liver slices were fixed in methacarn solution for 4\u22125 h at 4°C with gentle agitation.
p4636
aVFor embedding, liver slices were dehydrated three times for 1 h in fresh 99.5% ethanol at 4°C, immersed in xylene for 1 h and then three times for 30 min at room temperature, and then immersed in hot paraffin (60°C) four times for 1 h, for a total of 4 h. Paraffin-embedded tissues (PETs) were stored at 4°C until use.
p4637
aVThree serial 20-\u03bcm thick sections for evaluation of region-specific gene expression analyses using LMD and two serial 2-\u03bcm thick sections for identification of GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative lesions for microdissection were prepared from methacarn-fixed rat liver PETs, respectively.
p4638
aVFour sets of these sections were prepared.
p4639
aVThe 20-\u03bcm thick sections were mounted on PEN-foil film (Leica Microsystems Japan) and then dried in an incubator overnight at 37°C.
p4640
aVThe 2-\u03bcm thick sections were subjected to routine H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemical staining for rat GST-P to identify proliferative lesions for the microdissection.
p4641
aVThe sections for LMD were deparaffinized and stained with cresyl violet using LCM Staining Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol and air-dried.
p4642
aVGST-P\u2212positive and/or GST-P\u2212negative foci/tumor and corresponding surrounding tissues were microdissected with the use of an LMD system (Leica Microsystems Japan) from five animals of each of the DEN-alone and DEN-FF groups.
p4643
aVThe presence of GST-P\u2212positive and/or GST-P\u2212negative lesions in the sections for LMD was confirmed by setting the microscopic figures in the sections for LMD against those in the serial sections of H&amp;E staining and GST-P immunohistochemical staining.
p4644
aVTotal RNA was isolated using RNAqueous-Micro (Ambion) (and if RNA amplification was required, MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification [Ambion] was applied), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
p4645
aVcDNAs were synthesized from 100 ng (if RNA amplification was not performed) or 1 \u03bcg (if RNA amplification was performed) of total RNA as the template.
p4646
aVTo assess the mRNA levels of genes involved in oxidative and metabolic stress in the preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions, we assessed the mRNA levels of the following six genes with the use of real-time RT-PCR: Aco, Cyp4a1, Apex1, Xrcc5, Gpx2, and Gsta2.
p4647
aVTo obtain the relative quantitative values for gene expression, \u03b2-actin (Actb) was used as an endogenous control, and its expression levels were calculated according to the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
p4648
aVAll results were presented as mean ± SD.
p4649
aVSince the experimental design was 2 × 2 (as indicated in Fig.
p4650
aV1), the data shown in Tables 2 and 3 were analyzed by the two-way ANOVA.
p4651
aVAfter performing the ANOVA, Tukey-type multiple comparison test was adopted to make a comparison between the groups.
p4652
aVThe incidences and multiplicities of neoplastic lesions observed in the DEN-alone and DEN-FF group were analyzed by the Fisher's exact test and F-test, respectively.
p4653
aVThe differences of region-specific mRNA expression in multigroups between the surrounding tissue of DEN-alone group and other regions, between the GST-P\u2212positive foci of DEN-alone group and GST-P\u2212positive or \u2212negative foci of DEN-FF group, and between the surrounding tissue of DEN-FF group and other regions of DEN-FF group were analyzed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test, following the test of the homogeneity of variance between the groups by using Bartlett's test.
p4654
aVWhen the data were homogenous, Dunnett's test was used, and when heterogeneous, Dunnett's rank sum test was used.
p4655
aVA p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
p4656
aVThe results are shown in Table 2.
p4657
aVAll rats survived until their scheduled sacrifices except for three animals that did not survive PH.
p4658
aVTwo-way ANOVA showed that final body weights, food intake, and relative liver weights were attributed to the FF treatments.
p4659
aVWith respect to the comparison between the DEN-alone group and DEN-FF group, final body weights significantly decreased and relative liver weights significantly increased in the DEN-FF group as compared with the DEN-alone group.
p4660
aVThe criteria used for histopathological evaluation of the hepatocellular proliferative lesions were those stated in Guides for Toxicologic Pathology, published by the Society of Toxicologic Pathology (Goodman et al., 1994),
p4661
aVand the results of histopathological examinations and quantitative analyses of hepatocellular altered foci (HAF) and GST-P\u2212positive foci are shown in Table 2.
p4662
aVBy histopathological examination, HAF, consisting of eosinophilic or basophilic hepatocytes, hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), and HCCs were found in the livers of DEN-alone and DEN-FF groups.
p4663
aVThe results of the two-way ANOVA showed that the number of HAF and the multiplicity of HCAs were affected by the factors such as FF treatments and both treatments with DEN initiation and PH, and interactions of these factors were observed in the case of multiplicity of HCAs.
p4664
aVThe multiplicity of carcinoma was also affected by both treatments with DEN initiation and PH.
p4665
aVIn addition, Tukey-type multiple comparison test showed that the number of HAF and multiplicity of HCAs significantly increased in the DEN-FF group as compared with the DEN-alone group.
p4666
aVFisher's exact test showed that the incidence of HCAs significantly increased in the DEN-FF group as compared with the DEN-alone group.
p4667
aVOn the other hand, although the multiplicity of HCCs was affected by both treatments with DEN initiation and PH, no significant differences were observed between the DEN-alone and DEN-FF groups.
p4668
aVWith respect to the nontreated control and FF groups, a few number of HAF was observed in the FF group.
p4669
aVHowever, the number of HAF in the FF group was very scarce, and these values were about 1/30 of those in the DEN-FF group.
p4670
aVIn addition, histopathological examinations and immunohistochemical examinations for GST-P demonstrated an obvious increase in GST-P\u2212negative tumors in the DEN-FF group but not in the GST-P\u2212positive lesions in the DEN-FF group compared with the DEN-alone group.
p4671
aVThe two-way ANOVA showed that the number of GST-P\u2212negative tumors was affected by the factors such as FF treatments, both treatments with DEN initiation and PH, and their interactions.
p4672
aVAlthough the number and area of GST-P\u2212positive foci and the number of GST-P\u2212positive tumors were affected by the treatments with DEN initiation and PH, no significant differences were observed between the DEN-alone and DEN-FF groups.
p4673
aVThe number and area of GST-P\u2212positive foci in the FF group were very scarce, and these values were about 1/10 of those in the DEN-FF group.
p4674
aVThe Schmorl reaction revealed that most hepatic altered foci and tumors in the DEN-FF group had small amounts of lipofuscin, while high levels of depositions of this pigment were observed in the surrounding normal hepatocytes (Figure 3C).
p4675
aVThe results are shown in Table 2.
p4676
aVThe results of two-way ANOVA showed that both results of total GST activity and 8-OHdG levels in liver DNA were affected by the FF treatments.
p4677
aVIn addition, total GST activity was significantly decreased in the DEN-FF group compared with that in the DEN-alone group.
p4678
aVThe 8-OHdG levels in liver DNA of the DEN-FF group were significantly increased compared to the corresponding values in the DEN-alone group.
p4679
aVSince there were no changes in the 8-OHdG values between the DEN-alone and the NT group, it was recognized that treatment with DEN had no effect on the formation of 8-OHdG, indicating that the production of 8-OHdG was induced by the continuous administration of FF.
p4680
aVThe results of real-time RT-PCR are shown in Table 3.
p4681
aVThe results of two-way ANOVA showed that mRNA expressions of genes except for Mlh1 and Yc2 were affected by the FF treatments.
p4682
aVThe effect of interactions in addition to FF treatment was observed in the case of Mlh1.
p4683
aVIn the case of Yc2, the effect of both treatments with DEN initiation and PH in addition to FF treatments was also observed.
p4684
aVComparison between DEN-alone and DEN-FF groups revealed significantly increased expressions of Aco, Cyp4a1, Apex1, Xrcc5, Mlh1, Nbn, Gadd45a, Gpx2, Ugt1a6, and Yc2 and decreased Gsta2, Gstm2, and Gstm3 in the DEN-FF group.
p4685
aVOn the other hand, the changes observed in the FF-alone group were similar to those of DEN-FF group.
p4686
aVIn Ogg1 mRNA, no significant differences were observed between the DEN-alone group and DEN-FF groups.
p4687
aVAmong the above 14 genes, the expression levels of six genes, Aco, Cyp4a1, Apex1, Xrcc5, Gpx2, and Gsta2, were examined to reveal differences of region-specific expression of genes involved in oxidative stress, DNA repair, and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes.
p4688
aVThe mRNA levels of Aco and Cyp4a1, which are involved in the production of H2O2, were significantly increased in GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative foci of the DEN-FF group compared with the GST-P\u2212positive foci of the DEN-alone group, while these expression levels were significantly decreased in GST-P\u2212positive foci of the DEN-FF group compared with the surrounding tissue of the DEN-FF group (Figure 2).
p4689
aVThe mRNA levels of Apex1 and Xrcc5, which are involved in DNA repair, were significantly increased in GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative foci of the DEN-FF group compared with GST-P\u2212positive foci of the DEN\u2212alone group, while obvious changes were not observed in GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative foci of the DEN-FF group compared with the surrounding tissue of DEN-FF group (Figure 2).
p4690
aVThe mRNA levels of Gpx2 and Gsta2 were significantly increased in the GST-P\u2212positive foci and/or tumors of the DEN-FF group compared with those of surrounding tissue of the DEN-FF group, while these levels in GST-P\u2212negative foci and tumors of the DEN-FF group were not significantly increased in the surrounding tissues of the DEN-FF group (Figure 3A).
p4691
aVNrf2 has a close connection to oxidative stress and is a central transcription factor involved in the transcriptional activation of many genes encoding phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes via the ARE (Hayes and McMahon, 2001).
p4692
aVTherefore, we conducted immunohistochemistry to determine the localization of transcription factor Nrf2 in GST-P\u2212positive or GST-P\u2212negative foci or tumors.
p4693
aVThe cytoplasm of most cells forming GST-P\u2212positive foci and/or tumors in the DEN-alone and DEN-FF groups was negative for Nrf2, but the accumulation of Nrf2 was observed in the nuclei of some of these cells (Figure 4C).
p4694
aVIn contrast, the cytoplasm of most cells forming GST-P\u2212negative foci and/or tumors was positive for Nrf2, although some of the nuclei of these cells were also positive for Nrf2 (Figure 4A and B).
p4695
aVIn the quantitative evaluation of Nrf2-positive HAF (&gt; 0.2 mm), the number and area of Nrf2-positive foci in the DEN-FF group was significantly increased compared to that of the DEN-alone group and was increased twofold in number and eightfold in area compared to the GST-P\u2212positive foci in the DEN-FF group (Figure 4E).
p4696
aVBecause there may be differences in Nrf2 function between GST-P\u2212positive or GST-P\u2212negative foci, we performed immunohistochemistry for Gpx2, which is transcriptionally regulated by activated Nrf2 (Dewa et al., 2008).
p4697
aVContrary to the fluctuation of Nrf2, the expression of Gpx2 protein was observed in some lesions that expressed GST-P protein in the DEN-alone and DEN-FF groups, while those of GST-P\u2212negative foci and/or tumors were not observed (Figure 4D).
p4698
aVThe present analyses using whole liver revealed that FF continuously exerted increased fatty acid oxidation and DNA-damaging effects, such as elevation of 8-OHdG in liver DNA, and increased mRNA levels of DNA repair enzymes during the stage of tumor formation.
p4699
aVIn addition, decreased GST activity was observed with concomitant decrease in the expression of some GST subunits in the FF-treated groups.
p4700
aVGST substrate, CDNB, has the broadest range of isozyme detectability (e.g., alpha-, mu-, pi-, and other GST isoforms).
p4701
aVTherefore, it was considered that the GST activity in the present study was the value containing the activity of the isozyme assayed for by either of the genes assayed by mRNA levels.
p4702
aVThese findings suggest the possibility that the oxidative stress was induced continuously and decreased activities of its eliminating enzymes further perturb redox balances.
p4703
aVFurthermore, under such circumstances, a significant increase in the number of HAF as well as the incidence and multiplicity of HCAs observed in the DEN-FF group compared with the DEN-alone group strongly suggest that FF has a liver tumor-promoting effect through the production of reactive oxygen species.
p4704
aVOn the other hand, a limited accumulation of lipofuscin, which is known as an indirect indicator of oxidative stress (Reddy et al., 1982), was observed in hepatocellular proliferative lesions induced by FF, in contrast to excess lipofuscin accumulation in surrounding normal liver tissues.
p4705
aVThis finding suggests that there are different regulations in the elimination of oxidative stress between the proliferative lesions and surrounding tissues.
p4706
aVReddy et al.
p4707
aV(1982) noted that the relative amount of oxidative stress decreased with increased cell proliferation and mitosis in neoplastic cells of F344 rats treated with the PP, methyl clofenapate.
p4708
aVIn contrast, various analyses using whole liver tissues in the present study did not indicate any differences between the FF-alone and DEN-FF groups except for histopathological findings.
p4709
aVThese findings indicate that treatment with DEN does not make any qualitative differences in the liver of rats given FF.
p4710
aVThus, in the present study, we focused on hepatocellular proliferative lesions consisting of GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative lesions and performed region-specific analyses using LMD and gene expression analyses and immunohistochemistry.
p4711
aVFirst, we investigated differences in the region-specific mRNA levels of H2O2-generating enzymes, such as Aco and Cyp4a1, and DNA repair enzymes, such as Apex1 and Xrcc5.
p4712
aVThese genes were shown to be upregulated in our previous studies (Nishimura et al., 2007, 2008) as well as by the analyses of the present study using the whole liver.
p4713
aVOur data in the region-specific analyses demonstrated decreased levels of Aco and Cyp4a1 mRNA, which are regulated by PPAR\u03b1, in GST-P\u2212positive foci compared with the surrounding tissue of the DEN-FF group, although these levels significantly increased in the GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative foci of the DEN-FF group compared with the GST-P\u2212positive foci of the DEN-alone group.
p4714
aVThese data suggest the possible involvement of differences in PPAR\u03b1 activation between GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative foci in the liver of rats given FF.
p4715
aVIndeed, there have been several reports demonstrating repression of peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (enoyl-CoA hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase [BE]), expression in hepatic lesions of rats induced by PPs (Yokoyama et al., 1993), and repressed PPAR\u03b1 expression in BE-negative foci (Kudo et al., 2006).
p4716
aVWith respect to the DNA repair enzymes, mRNA analyses using LMD in liver tumors of mice induced by dicyclanil has demonstrated no remarkable upregulation of an oxidative DNA damage repair gene, such as Ogg1, combined with the negative regulation of apoptosis and the induction of oxidative stress (Moto et al., 2006).
p4717
aVThis means that there is a high possibility of reduced DNA repair ability in these hepatocellular proliferative lesions compared with the normal surrounding areas.
p4718
aVIn contrast, in our study, the expressions of Apex1 and Xrcc5 in the hepatocellular proliferative lesions of the DEN-FF group were higher than those of GST-P\u2212positive foci of the DEN-alone group.
p4719
aVHowever, there were no marked differences in the expressions of Apex1 and Xrcc5 between the hepatocellular proliferative lesions and surrounding tissue of the DEN-FF group.
p4720
aVThese results may suggest the possibility that FF-induced hepatocellular proliferative lesions, including GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative lesions, still preserve DNA repairing ability during the stage of tumor formation.
p4721
aVIn other words, our data suggest that continuous oxidative stress was induced in all areas of the liver and resulted in increased 8-OHdG levels in the liver DNA of rats in the DEN-FF group.
p4722
aVOn the other hand, these results may lead the supposition that these genes have a slight effect on the growth of hepatocellular proliferative lesions of the DEN-FF group.
p4723
aVHowever, the details were unknown, but the fact that PPAR\u03b1 knockout mice do not induce any increase in the expression of DNA repair genes (Rusyn et al., 2004) and do not develop hepatocarcinogenesis (Gonzalez, 1997; Peters et al., 1997) will suggest that there are some relationship between the fluctuated DNA repair genes and tumor development of FF.
p4724
aVNuclear levels of Nrf2 increase when peritoneal macrophages are treated with oxidative stressors, such as diethyl maleate and paraquat (Ishii et al., 2000).
p4725
aVThese changes were also found in the liver when D3T and \u03b2-naphthoflavone were administered to rats (Kwak et al., 2001a, 2001b).
p4726
aVOur present study revealed different levels of expression of Nrf2 in GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative foci induced by FF.
p4727
aVThis is the first report to identify the different distribution of Nrf2 in GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative lesions induced by PPs.
p4728
aVImmunohistochemistry for Nrf2 in the GST-P\u2212positive lesions showed decreased Nrf2 expression in the cytoplasm, but the nuclei of some cells forming these altered foci and tumors of the DEN-FF group were immunoreactive for Nrf2.
p4729
aVIn contrast, GST-P\u2212negative foci and tumors showed enhanced Nrf2 expression in the cytoplasm, while there were some cells showing nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in these proliferative lesions.
p4730
aVIn addition, our region-specific analyses revealed overexpression of Gpx2 and/or Gsta2, which are known to be regulated by Nrf2 (Dewa et al., 2008; Rushmore et al., 1990), and enhanced Gpx2 protein levels in some GST-P\u2212positive lesions of the DEN-alone and/or DEN-FF groups.
p4731
aVGpx2 mRNA has been reported to be upregulated in the liver GST-P\u2212positive foci by other researchers (Suzuki et al., 2004).
p4732
aVThese results suggest that the activation of Nrf2, due to nuclear translocation of Nrf2, was induced in GST-P\u2212positive proliferative lesions.
p4733
aVOn the other hand, in the present study, the cytoplasm of most cells forming GST-P\u2212negative foci and/or tumors was positive for Nrf2, although some of the nuclei of these cells were also positive for Nrf2.
p4734
aVSuch a relative increase in intracytoplasmic accumulation of Nrf2 in GST-P\u2212negative lesions may result from inactive Nrf2 accumulation in the cytoplasm.
p4735
aVIn addition, there have been some reports that Nrf2 acts as a positive transcription factor for GST-P expression (Ikeda et al., 2004; Ohta et al., 2007).
p4736
aVFan et al.
p4737
aV(2008) previously reported that GST-P\u2212positive foci were devoid of Nrf2 expression and GST-P\u2212negative foci expressed higher levels of Nrf2 in HAF induced by the Solt-Farber protocol.
p4738
aVTheir interpretation, with respect to Nrf2 expression, is different from our interpretation as our data strongly support the view of Ikeda et al.
p4739
aVand of Ohta et al.
p4740
aVGST-P also modulates the activities of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Yin et al., 2000).
p4741
aVThis factor was activated by various stress-associated stimuli, cytokines, and growth factors and control many aspects of mammalian cellular physiology, including cell growth, differentiation, and cell death (Ip and Davis, 1998; Kyriakis and Avruch, 1996).
p4742
aVTaking into account these findings and the results of our study, it can be considered that inhibition of transcriptional factors, via decreased GST-P expression, and of nuclear translocation of Nrf2 occurs in GST-P\u2212negative proliferative lesions induced by FF and may enhance the tumor promotion in these proliferative lesions.
p4743
aVIn conclusion, our data demonstrated the different localization of Nrf2 protein and of Nrf2-regulated enzymes between GST-P\u2212positive and GST-P\u2212negative lesions in rats initiated with DEN and promoted by FF and suggest that the activation of Nrf2 by nuclear translocation occurs in the GST-P\u2212positive lesions.
p4744
aVIn contrast, although no obvious regional differences in mRNA levels of DNA repair enzymes were observed in the liver of rats given FF, the regional differences of the expression of eliminating enzymes of oxidative stress such as Gsta2 and Gpx2 were observed in the liver of rats given FF.
p4745
aVThe development of continuous oxidative stress was identified in whole liver by mRNA expression analyses, as well as by measurements of GST activity and 8-OHdG levels.
p4746
aVIn addition, the cytoplasm of most cells forming GST-P\u2212negative foci and/or tumors was positive for Nrf2, although some of the nuclei of these cells were also positive for Nrf2.
p4747
aVThese results suggest that the relative inhibition of nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in GST-P\u2212negative lesions aggravates the condition of the oxidative stress in the liver of rats given FF, resulting in enhanced tumor promotion in FF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
p4748
aVAdditional investigations are now in progress to clarify further the mechanism of tumor promotion in FF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.

aVGrape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) possess anticarcinogenic activities.
p4750
aVHere, we assessed the effects of dietary GSPs on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced skin tumor promotion in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mouse skin.
p4751
aVAdministration of dietary GSPs (0.2 and 0.5%, wt/wt) supplemented with control AIN76A diet resulted in significant inhibition of TPA-induced skin tumor promotion in C3H/HeN mice.
p4752
aVThe mice treated with GSPs developed a significantly lower tumor burden in terms of the percentage of mice with tumors (P &lt; 0.05), total number of tumors per group (P &lt; 0.01, n = 20) and total tumor volume per tumor-bearing mouse (P &lt; 0.01\u20130.001) as compared with the mice that received the control diet.
p4753
aVGSPs also delayed the malignant progression of papillomas into carcinomas.
p4754
aVAs TPA-induced inflammatory responses are used routinely as markers of skin tumor promotion, we assessed the effect of GSPs on biomarkers of TPA-induced inflammation.
p4755
aVImmunohistochemical analysis and western blotting revealed that GSPs significantly inhibited expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and markers of proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D1) in both the DMBA-initiated/TPA-promoted mouse skin and skin tumors.
p4756
aVIn short-term experiments in which the mouse skin was treated with acute or multiple TPA applications, we found that dietary GSPs inhibited TPA-induced edema, hyperplasia, leukocytes infiltration, myeloperoxidase, COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in the mouse skin.
p4757
aVThe inhibitory effect of GSPs was also observed against other structurally different skin tumor promoter-induced inflammation in the skin.
p4758
aVTogether, our results show that dietary GSPs inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in mouse skin and that the inhibition of skin tumorigenesis by GSPs is associated with the inhibition of inflammatory responses caused by tumor promoters.
p4759
aVThe incidence of skin cancer is equivalent to the incidence of malignancies in all other organs combined (1), and thus represents a major, and growing, public health problem.
p4760
aVThe continuing increase in life expectancy, the depletion of the ozone layer that allows more solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach at the surface of the Earth, together with changing dietary habits and lifestyle appear to be contributing factors for the increasing risk of skin cancer.
p4761
aVIn addition to the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, it is a major burden on the health care system as it has been estimated that the cost of treating non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers in the USA is US$ 2.9 billion annually (www.cancer.org/statistics).
p4762
aVEffective chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents and strategies to address this disease are being sought and one such strategy, the use of botanicals, is becoming increasingly popular in USA as a means to protect against skin disorders, including skin cancers.

aVGrapes (Vitis vinifera) are consumed worldwide.
p4764
aVThey are rich in polyphenols, with 60\u201370% of grape polyphenols being found in the seeds, which are available as by-products of the industrial production of grape juice and wine.
p4765
aVThe seeds contain a larger fraction of proanthocyanidins, which are primarily composed of dimers, trimers and oligomers of monomeric catechins or epicatechins (2\u20134).
p4766
aVThese grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) have been shown to have antioxidant (5,6), anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic (7,8) properties.

aVGSPs induce cytotoxic effects in various cancer cell lines (9\u201311) with no apparent adverse biological effects on normal cells, i.e.

aVhuman epidermal keratinocytes (5,12).
p4769
aVWe have shown previously that supplementation of the diet with GSPs inhibits UV radiation-induced skin carcinogenesis in SKH-1 hairless mice (8), and long-term feeding of a GSPs-supplemented diet did not result in any apparent signs of toxicity in mice (8,9).
p4770
aVThe development of skin cancer is a multistage process that includes initiation, promotion and progression in experimental animal models and possibly in human cancer includes induction and propagation (13).
p4771
aVDuring the early tumor promotion stage of multistage carcinogenesis, the process is reversible but the initiation stage is irreversible and presumably unavoidable because of continuing exposure to carcinogenic chemicals and physical agents (13).
p4772
aVA commonly used two-stage model of skin cancer involves initiation by treatment of the skin with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) followed by promotion through treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA).
p4773
aVIn this study, we determined the effect of dietary GSPs on TPA-promoted skin tumor development in DMBA-initiated mouse skin and then examined the chemopreventive mechanism of GSPs in this model.
p4774
aVTo our knowledge, this is the first study showing that dietary GSPs exert an antitumor promoting effect in TPA-promoted skin tumor development in DMBA-initiated mouse skin.
p4775
aVWe further show using this two-stage skin cancer model that the inhibition of TPA-caused skin tumor promotion by dietary GSPs is associated with the inhibition of TPA-induced inflammatory responses.

aVExperimental diets containing GSPs (0.2 and 0.5%, wt/wt) are prepared in pellet form in the AIN76A powdered control diet by TestDiet® (Richmond, IN) for our research using the GSPs that we provide for this purpose.
p4787
aVIn carcinogenesis studies, the GSP-supplemented diet was provided to the mice starting 1 week after initiation with DMBA or at the start of TPA application and continued until the termination of the experiment.
p4788
aVThe dorsal skin area of the female C3H/HeN mice was shaved with electric clippers and depilated skin lotion was applied for 2\u20133 min.

aVThe area was then washed with water.
p4790
aVSixty mice received a single topical application of 400 nmol of DMBA in 0.2 ml of acetone (tumor initiation).
p4791
aVOne week later, the mice were treated topically with TPA (10 nmol per mouse per 100 \u03bcl acetone) (tumor promotion) and this treatment was repeated twice weekly throughout the course of the experiment.
p4792
aVThe 60 mice that were treated with DMBA were randomly allocated into three treatment groups with 20 mice in each group.
p4793
aVAll groups were treated with TPA.
p4794
aVMice in group 1 were fed an unsupplemented standard AIN76A diet; mice in group 2 received the standard AIN76A diet supplemented with GSPs (0.2%, wt/wt) and mice in group 3 received the standard AIN76A diet supplemented with GSPs (0.5%, wt/wt).
p4795
aVThe selection of the concentrations of GSPs in the diet was based on our prior studies in which dietary administration of GSPs as a supplement to an AIN76A diet inhibited UVB-induced oxidative stress (6) as well as UVB-induced skin tumor development in mice (8).
p4796
aVTwo groups of control mice were used.
p4797
aVOne group of mice (n = 10) was treated with vehicle (0.2 ml acetone) alone twice a week and served as a negative control to assess spontaneous tumor induction.
p4798
aVA second group of mice (n = 10) was initiated with the DMBA (400 nmol per mouse per 0.2 ml acetone) and 1 week later were provided a diet supplemented with GSPs (0.5%, wt/wt) until the termination of the experiment, as described for groups 1\u20133.
p4799
aVAt the termination of the experiment, tumor samples and tumor-uninvolved skin samples were collected for the analysis of various biomarkers of interest as described below.
p4800
aVTo determine the chemopreventive mechanism of GSPs on TPA-induced tumor promotion activities, we also conducted short-term in vivo experiments.
p4801
aVIn these experiments, TPA (10 nmol per mouse per 200 \u03bcl acetone) was applied topically to the shaved skin of C3H/HeN mice.
p4802
aVThe TPA was either applied three times on alternate days (multiple treatments) and the mice were killed 6 h after the last treatment or the TPA was applied once and the mice were killed at 6, 12 or 24 h later (acute treatment).
p4803
aVThe mice were either provided the unsupplemented standard AIN76A diet or the AIN76A diet supplemented with 0.5% (wt/wt) GSPs.
p4804
aVThis concentration of GSPs was used as we had found that it significantly inhibited tumor promotion in the skin tumorigenesis protocol.
p4805
aVThe GSP-supplemented diet was provided at least 1 week before the topical application of TPA.
p4806
aVSkin samples from the treated areas were collected at the time of killing for determining the effect of dietary GSPs on TPA-induced inflammatory responses.
p4807
aVIn some experiments, structurally different tumor promoters (mezerein, benzoylperoxide, anthralin) were used in the place of TPA.
p4808
aVThe skin of the mice that had been subjected to the DMBA/TPA two-stage skin tumor protocol was examined once a week for the appearance of papillomas or tumors until the yield and size of the tumors had stabilized.
p4809
aVGrowths that were &gt;1 mm in diameter and that persisted for at least 2 weeks were defined as tumors and recorded.
p4810
aVThe dimensions of all the tumors were recorded at the termination of the experiment and tumor volumes were calculated using the hemiellipsoid model formula: tumor volume = , where l = length, w = width and h = height.
p4811
aVAt the termination of the skin tumor protocol, representative biopsies from all the skin tumors were collected, fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.
p4812
aVDeparafinized sections (5 \u03bcm thick) were stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin for pathological evaluation by three independent observers who were blinded to the source of the tissues.
p4813
aVThe specimens were classified as tumors or non-neoplastic lesions according to the following criteria: loss of keratinization or keratinized centers, the presence of horn pearls and atypical cells.
p4814
aVFive micrometer thick frozen sections were hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then non-specific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% goat serum in PBS.
p4815
aVThe sections were incubated with anti-COX-2 or anti-PCNA antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed and then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 45 min followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin.

aVThe epidermis or tumor tissue samples were pooled from at least three mice in each group, and three sets of pooled samples from each treatment group were used to prepare lysates, thus n = 10.
p4823
aVFor immunoblotting, proteins (20\u201335 \u03bcg) were resolved on 10% Tris\u2013glycine gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.
p4824
aVAfter blocking the non-specific binding sites, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody at 4°C overnight.
p4825
aVThe membrane was then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).

p4831
aVBriefly, the skin samples were homogenized in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide followed by sonication of the homogenate at 4°C for three 10 s bursts with a heat system sonicator equipped with a microprobe.
p4832
aVThe resulting supernatants were used for MPO estimation.
p4833
aVMPO activity in the supernatant (0.1 ml) was assayed by mixing with 50 mM phosphate buffer (2.9 ml), pH 6.0, containing 0.167 mg/ml o-dianisidine dihydrochloride and 0.0005% hydrogen peroxide.

aVThe statistical significance of difference between the values of control and treatment groups was determined using the Student's t-test.
p4844
aVThe GSP-supplemented diet reduced TPA-promoted skin tumor development in DMBA-initiated mouse skin in terms of tumor incidence (Figure 1A), tumor multiplicity (Figure 1B) and tumor size (Figure 1C) as compared with the control diet.
p4845
aVThe tumor incidence was 35% (P &lt; 0.05) lower in the mice fed the diet supplemented with 0.5% GSPs than in the mice fed the unsupplemented control diet at the termination of the experiment (27th week).
p4846
aVAlthough supplementation of the diet with the lower dose (0.2%) of GSPs resulted in a 20% lower tumor incidence, this effect did not reach statistical significance.
p4847
aVImportantly, the tumors that developed in the mice fed the GSP-supplemented diets exhibited an increased latency period with a 4-week delay in the mice administered 0.2% GSPs and a 10-week delay in the mice administered 0.5% GSPs in the diet under the experimental conditions used in these studies.
p4848
aVA total of 23 tumors were recorded in the group of mice that did not receive GSPs, whereas 13 tumors (43% inhibition, P &lt; 0.01) were recorded in the group of mice fed 0.2% GSPs and only seven tumors (70% inhibition, P &lt; 0.001) were recorded in the group of mice fed 0.5% GSPs (Figure 1B and Table I).
p4849
aVAdditionally, the tumor size was significantly lower in the mice that were provided GSPs in the diet (32%, P &lt; 0.01 in mice receiving 0.2% GSPs and 70%, P &lt; 0.001 in mice receiving 0.5% GSPs) than in the mice receiving the control diet (Figure 1C and Table I).
p4850
aVOverall, both the rate of appearance of the TPA-induced tumors and their development in the GSP-treated mice was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05, Fisher\u2013Irwin exact test) than in the mice that were not fed GSPs.
p4851
aVThe mice in the control group that were treated with vehicle alone or treated with GSPs did not develop tumors within the 27-week study period.

aVsuggesting that administration of dietary GSPs does not produce any apparent signs of toxicity in mice at least at the concentrations used and within the time frame of the current experiments.
p4854
aVHistopathologic examination of the tumors at the termination of the experiment revealed that of the 23 tumors in the group of mice that received the unsupplemented control diet, four were squamous cell carcinomas, 15 squamous cell papillomas and four keratoacanthomas.
p4855
aVOf the 13 tumors in the group of mice that received the diet supplemented with 0.2% GSPs, one was squamous cell carcinoma, 10 were squamous cell papillomas and two keratoacanthomas; whereas, of the seven tumors in the group of mice that were provided 0.5% GSPs, there were six squamous cell papillomas and one keratoacanthoma.
p4856
aVThus, the majority of tumors were squamous cell papillomas and were of epidermal origin.
p4857
aVAlthough 20% of the mice that were provided the control diet developed carcinoma, only 5% of the mice that were provided 0.2% GSPs developed carcinoma, and none of the mice which were provided 0.5% GSPs developed carcinoma during the entire treatment protocol.
p4858
aVThe total number of carcinomas at the termination of the experiment in the group of mice that received the control diet was four; therefore, 17% of the papillomas were converted into carcinomas in this group; whereas, only one carcinoma was recorded in the group of mice that were provided 0.2% GSPs and only 7.7% of the papillomas were converted into carcinomas in this group.
p4859
aVTaken together with the absence of carcinomas in the group of mice that were provided 0.5% GSPs, these data suggest that the risk of malignant progression of papillomas into carcinomas in GSP-treated mice was significantly reduced compared with the control mice that were not given GSPs in the diet.
p4860
aVChronic inflammation has been shown to promote tumor development (13,16).
p4861
aVAs supplementation of the AIN76A control diet with 0.5% GSPs significantly inhibited TPA-induced skin tumor promotion in mice in the chemical carcinogenesis protocol (Figure 1),
p4862
aVwe used the skin and tumor samples from this group and control group for further mechanistic analysis.
p4863
aVA characteristic response of keratinocytes to tumor promoters is enhanced COX-2 expression and a subsequent increase in the production of PG metabolites in the skin (13,16); moreover, elevated expression of COX-2 and prostaglandin (PG) metabolites has been observed in squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin (16,17).
p4864
aVOf the PG metabolites, PGE2 appears to play a pivotal role in tumor promotion.
p4865
aVImmunohistochemical
p4866
aVAND
p4867
aVanalysis confirmed that, in mice that were fed the unsupplemented control diet, the expression of COX-2 was higher in the skin of DMBA/TPA-treated mice than in skin of the mice that were not treated with DMBA/TPA (Figure 2A).
p4868
aVThe expression of COX-2 in the skin of the DMBA/TPA-treated mice that were provided the GSP-supplemented diet was lower than that in the skin of the DMBA/TPA-treated mice that were fed the unsupplemented control diet (Figure 2A).
p4869
aVSimilarly, the levels of COX-2 expression in the skin tumors were lower in the DMBA/TPA-treated mice that were provided the GSP-supplemented diet than in the tumors in the mice that were provided the control diet (Figure 2B).
p4870
aVThese data were confirmed by western blot analysis, which showed higher expression levels of COX-2 protein in DMBA/TPA-treated mouse skin and skin tumors and GSPs inhibition of this DMBA/TPA-induced elevation in the expression levels of COX-2 in the mouse skin and skin tumors (Figure 2C).
p4871
aVAs shown in Figure 2D, we also found that the levels of PGE2 in the skin and tumors of the DMBA/TPA-treated mice were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) than non-DMBA/TPA-treated mouse skin samples.
p4872
aVThe administration of GSPs significantly inhibited (P &lt; 0.01) the DMBA/TPA-induced elevation in the levels of PGE2 in both skin and skin tumors.
p4873
aVThe proliferation potential of epidermal cells (i.e.
p4874
aVthe hyperplastic response) is another marker of the TPA-induced inflammatory reaction in the skin.
p4875
aVImmunohistochemical analysis revealed that DMBA/TPA application enhances the proliferation potential of epidermal keratinocytes as indicated by the PCNA staining pattern in the epidermis and that GSPs inhibited this DMBA/TPA-induced expression of PCNA in both skin (Figure 3A) and skin tumor (Figure 3B) samples.
p4876
aVThese data were further confirmed by western blot analysis, as shown in Figure 3C.
p4877
aVSimilarly, western blot analysis revealed that dietary GSPs inhibited DMBA/TPA-induced increase in the expression levels of cyclin D1 in both skin and skin tumor samples (Figure 3C).
p4878
aVTo further verify whether antitumor promotion effect of GSPs is associated with the inhibition of TPA-induced inflammatory responses,
p4879
aVshort-term experiments were performed.
p4880
aVIt was evident from the hematoxylin and eosin staining (Figure 4A) of the skin samples that the thickness of the epidermis is greater in the TPA-treated than in the non-TPA-treated mouse skin, which suggests a hyperplastic response to this tumor promoter; furthermore, the dietary GSPs inhibited this TPA-induced hyperplastic response in the skin.
p4881
aVWe therefore measured the epidermal thickness at five equidistant points along the entire length of the section from the dermo-epidermal junction to the top of stratum corneum, and all five values were averaged and reported as the mean epidermal thickness in micrometers.
p4882
aVSimilarly, the numbers of cell layers were counted from the dermo-epidermal junction to the bottom of the stratum corneum to determine the mean vertical thickness of cell layers in the epidermis.
p4883
aVAs shown in Figure 4A, 6 h after multiple TPA treatments, there was a significant increase in mean epidermal thickness (70 ± 10 \u03bcm) and mean vertical thickness of epidermal cell layers (6 ± 2) compared with the acetone-treated normal mouse skin (20.5 ± 5.0 \u03bcm thick and 2 ± 1 cell layers).
p4884
aVIn mice provided the GSP-supplemented diet, there was a significant reduction (&gt;50%, P &lt; 0.01) in this TPA-induced increase in epidermal thickness (39 ± 5 \u03bcm) and vertical thickness of epidermal cell layers (4 ± 1).
p4885
aVSimilar effects of GSPs were also observed when mice were treated once with TPA and the effects were determined 12 and 24 h later (Figure 4A).
p4886
aVDietary GSPs alone, however, did not induce an epidermal hyperplastic response in mouse skin (Figure 4A, upper panels).
p4887
aVDevelopment of edema is considered as a marker of inflammation.
p4888
aVAs determined by the weight of a 1 cm diameter punch of the skin, treatment of the skin with TPA resulted in a significantly higher skin punch weight (50% more, P &lt; 0.01).
p4889
aVThe provision of the GSP-supplemented diet significantly reduced (46%, P &lt; 0.01) the TPA-induced increase in punch weight, as shown in Table II.
p4890
aVSimilarly, provision of the GSP-supplemented diet reduced the increases in punch weight induced by multiple TPA applications.
p4891
aVOn analysis of the effects of dietary GSPs on the increase in punch weight induced by topical application of other structurally different skin tumor promoters, mezerein, benzoylperoxide and anthralin, we found that the GSPs also inhibited the induction of edema in terms of skin punch weight caused by these tumor promoters (Table II).
p4892
aVTo further verify the inhibitory effect of GSPs on tumor promoter-induced edema, we measured the bi-fold skin thickness before tumor promoter application and 6 h after acute treatment of various tumor promoters.
p4893
aVAs shown in Table II, the bi-fold skin thickness was increased significantly after acute (43%, P &lt; 0.01) or multiple TPA treatment (73%, P &lt; 0.005).
p4894
aVProvision of the GSP-supplemented diet significantly inhibited TPA-induced edema in terms of bi-fold thickness of the skin after acute (50%, P &lt; 0.01) and multiple treatment (41%, P &lt; 0.01) with TPA.
p4895
aVDietary GSPs also significantly inhibited the development of edema in terms of bi-fold skin thickness caused by other structurally different skin tumor promoters, as shown in Table II.
p4896
aVDietary GSPs alone did not affect the thickness of the skin, suggesting that GSPs alone do not induce inflammation in the mouse skin.
p4897
aVInfiltrating leukocytes are considered to be a major source of inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress (13,16,18).
p4898
aVRoutine hematoxylin and eosin staining of skin samples revealed that the skin treatment with TPA induces infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes (activated monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils) that peaks around 12\u201324 h post-TPA application (Figure 4A).
p4899
aVIt was observed that provision of the GSP-supplemented diet markedly reduced the number of TPA-induced infiltrating leukocytes in the treated skin sites at 12 and 24 h post-TPA treatment.
p4900
aVThis inhibitory effect of GSPs on TPA-induced leukocyte infiltration was also evident after multiple treatment of skin with TPA.
p4901
aVTo confirm that dietary GSPs inhibit TPA-induced infiltration of leukocytes in the treated sites, we determined the levels of MPO in skin homogenate samples from the various treatment groups.
p4902
aVWe found an increase in MPO activity in skin samples after treatment with TPA (Figure 4B),
p4903
aVsuggesting an influx of leukocytes into the inflamed skin.
p4904
aVThe provision of the GSP-supplemented diet significantly inhibited (P &lt; 0.01) TPA-induced MPO activity both after acute and multiple treatments of the skin with TPA and at all the time points studied.
p4905
aVThis GSP-induced reduction in MPO activity further suggests that the GSPs act, at least in part, to inhibit the TPA-induced inflammatory responses in the skin.
p4906
aVAs tumor promoter-induced COX-2 expression and a subsequent increase in the production of PG metabolites in the skin are considered as characteristic responses to inflammation,
p4907
aVwe further determined whether dietary GSPs inhibit TPA-induced COX-2 expression and thereby inhibit PGE2 production in mouse skin.
p4908
aVWestern blot analysis revealed that treatment of the mouse skin with TPA, either as a single or multiple applications, resulted in higher levels of COX-2 expression as compared with non-TPA-treated normal mouse skin (Figure 4C).
p4909
aVProvision of the GSP (0.5%, wt/wt)-supplemented diet resulted in inhibition of this TPA-induced increase in COX-2 expression at all time points studied after a single or multiple applications of TPA.
p4910
aVSimilarly, dietary GSPs significantly inhibited (P &lt; 0.01) TPA-induced increases in the levels of PGE2 after both single and multiple TPA treatments (Figure 4D).
p4911
aVIn our continuing efforts to develop newer and more effective dietary botanicals for the prevention of skin cancer, we first assessed the efficacy of dietary GSPs using a two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis protocol.
p4912
aVIn this study, we used the inbred C3H/HeN strain of mice as these mice can be appropriately used to study the effects of the tumor promoters, and the modification of these effects by GSPs, on inflammatory responses.
p4913
aVThe central finding of the present study is that dietary GSPs afford significant protection against TPA-induced skin tumor development in DMBA-initiated mouse skin, and the antitumor promotion effects are associated with the anti-inflammatory effects of the GSPs.
p4914
aVFurther, as the development of papillomas was delayed and growth slowed with GSPs treatment, GSPs also delayed the malignant conversion of papillomas to carcinomas.
p4915
aVA wide range of studies have shown that naturally occurring polyphenols, specifically those present in fruits and vegetables, common beverages, like green tea, and several herbs and plants with diverse pharmacological activities, are a promising classes of agents with the potential to act to inhibit tumor promotion (19\u201323).
p4916
aVGreen tea is a widely consumed beverage worldwide and the composition of GSPs differs from green tea polyphenols in their unique combination of proanthocyanidins, which are polyphenols but with a higher molecular weight than the green tea polyphenols.
p4917
aVGSPs are a mixture of dimers, trimers, tetramers and oligomers of monomeric catechin and epicatechin (7); whereas green tea polyphenols are mainly composed of monomers, such as catechins, epicatechins and their gallate esters, including (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (24).
p4918
aVHowever, the activity of dietary GSPs in inhibiting tumor promotion in the skin chemical carcinogenesis model used in these studies appears identical to the activity of green tea polyphenols in inhibiting tumor promotion in the skin (20).
p4919
aVWith the notion that targeting the tumor promotion stage could be a better strategy for the prevention of cancer, regular consumption of vegetables and fruits that are good source of polyphenols has been associated with a reduced risk for several malignancies (25\u201329).
p4920
aVIt has been recognized that inhibition of tumor promotion is most probably a better strategy for cancer chemoprevention than inhibition of the tumor initiation stage because initiation is a short irreversible event, whereas the tumor promotion stage is reversible during the early stages (13).
p4921
aVIt is well established that tumor promoters, such as TPA, induce inflammation and the mediators of inflammation are considered to be potent regulators of tumor promotion in skin cancers (13).
p4922
aVWe have shown earlier that topical application of TPA on the mouse skin enhances the expression of COX-2 (20),
p4923
aVwhich is one of the most important enzymes responsible for the development of inflammation and tumors.
p4924
aVCOX-2 is a rate-limiting enzyme for generation of PG metabolites from arachidonic acid (30).
p4925
aVCOX-2 overexpression has been linked to the pathophysiology of inflammation and cancer due to enhanced synthesis of PG metabolites (31), which have been shown to be potential contributing factor in chemical carcinogenesis.
p4926
aVIn this study, we found that dietary GSPs inhibit the elevation in the expression of COX-2 and greater production of PGE2 induced by chronic TPA exposure of DMBA-initiated mouse skin in both the skin and skin tumors, which may have contributed to the inhibition of the skin tumor development in the GSP-treated mice.
p4927
aVThe decreased proliferating potential of epidermal keratinocytes by dietary GSPs, which is indicated by the reduced expression of the PCNA and cyclin D1 proteins in the DMBA/TPA-induced skin and skin tumors, may also be contributing factors for the inhibitory effects of GSPs on the development of skin tumors.
p4928
aVThe infiltration and accumulation of activated macrophages and neutrophils after TPA treatment of the mouse skin is a characteristic feature of skin inflammation, and the quantification of infiltrating leukocytes in skin is used routinely as a measure for the intensity of inflammation (15,32).
p4929
aVThe levels of MPO also are commonly used as a quantitative marker of inflammatory infiltrates since normal skin exhibits low background levels of MPO, whereas skin that is inflamed by an infection, wounding or by the application of phorbol ester and other tumor promoters enhances the levels of MPO (15,32).
p4930
aVOur analysis of the effects of GSPs on the immediate responses induced by a single application of TPA in short-term in vivo experiments showed that dietary GSPs inhibited the infiltration of leukocytes in the mouse skin as well as reducing the levels of MPO activity at all the time points studied.
p4931
aVAdditionally, dietary GSPs reduced TPA-induced skin punch weight and bi-fold skin thickness, which were analyzed as markers of edema.
p4932
aVTPA-induced edema is considered to be a marker of tissue inflammation.
p4933
aVNotably, we confirmed that GSPs have the ability to inhibit various structurally different skin tumor promoter-induced inflammatory responses in the mouse skin.
p4934
aVCollectively, the data from the present study suggest that dietary GSPs have anti-skin tumor promotion activity and that the antitumor promotion activity of GSPs is associated with the inhibition of tumor promoter-induced inflammation in mouse skin.
p4935
aVThe results of the present study, in conjunction with prior publications from our laboratory and others, suggest that GSPs may prove to be useful chemopreventive agent against some forms of human cancers induced by environmental agents, and therefore, more detailed studies with particular emphasis on molecular mechanisms could lead to new strategies for cancer chemoprevention in humans.

aVThe T-cell\u2013dependent antibody response is suppressed in mice exposed to 3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30 mg PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid)/kg body weight (bw).
p4937
aVReduced bw accompanied immunosuppression at 15 and 30 mg/kg.
p4938
aVWe investigated the hypothesis that the observed immunosuppression is secondary to elevated serum corticosterone levels by assessing immune function in adrenalectomized (adx) or sham-operated C57BL/6N female mice exposed to 0, 7.5, or 15 mg PFOA/kg bw in drinking water for 10 days.
p4939
aVBw, primary antibody responses to a T-dependent antigen, clinical serum chemistries related to liver health, and serum corticosterone levels were evaluated.
p4940
aVExposure to 15 mg/kg decreased bw by approximately 10% after 8 days of dosing and until 2 days postdosing in both adx and sham animals; bw of adx animals were still reduced 5 days postdosing.
p4941
aVIgM antibody titers were statistically reduced by 15% in sham animals and 18% in adx animals exposed to 15 mg/kg and by 11.8% in adx animals exposed to 7.5 mg/kg.
p4942
aVCorticosterone concentrations were elevated by 157% in dosed sham animals relative to control animals and were reduced by 27% in dosed adx animals relative to control animals (neither changes were statistically significant).
p4943
aVClinical serum chemistries related to liver health were not statistically altered by either dose or adrenalectomy.
p4944
aVThe failure of adrenalectomy to protect mice from the immunosuppressive effects of PFOA indicates that suppression of antibody synthesis is not the result of liver toxicity or stress-related corticosterone production.
p4945
aVPerfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are fluorinated compounds used to manufacture myriad consumer products, from adhesives and fire retardant surfaces to nonstick coatings and lubricants.
p4946
aVPFAAs undergo chemical, microbial, and photolytic degradation to a limited number of extremely stable degradation products, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).
p4947
aVPFOA is also a polymerization aid used in the manufacture of fluorinated polymers and elastomers.
p4948
aVAs a result of its use and as a degradation product of other PFAAs, PFOA is widespread in environmental media and has been reported in the serum and tissues of humans and wildlife (Lau et al., 2007).
p4949
aVConcerns about PFOA's toxicological effects prompted a preliminary risk assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, although relatively few studies have evaluated PFOA's immunomodulatory potential, immunotoxicity was cited as an endpoint of concern in a review of the risk assessment by the EPA Science Advisory Board.
p4950
aVThe studies cited in the preliminary risk assessment reported reductions in lymphoid organ weights and suppression of de novo antibody synthesis (Yang et al., 2000, 2001, 2002).
p4951
aVIn these initial studies and in subsequent studies (DeWitt et al., 2008; Loveless et al., 2008), oral exposure to 30 mg PFOA/kg body weight (bw) reduced antigen-specific IgM antibody synthesis in mice.
p4952
aVWe previously reported that the serum concentration associated with this dose was 1.6 × 105 ng/ml after 15 days of exposure.
p4953
aVThe lowest observed adverse effect level for alteration of primary (IgM) antibody titers was 3.75 mg/kg, with a serum concentration of 7.4 × 104 ng/ml, which is approximately 150 times greater than concentrations in highly exposed human populations (DeWitt et al., 2008).
p4954
aVIn a previous study (unpublished data) the adrenal glands of female C57BL/6 mice exposed to 30 mg/kg PFOA via gavage for 10 or 15 days were enlarged relative to controls.
p4955
aVHistopathological analysis revealed increased cytoplasmic vacuolization in the zona fasciculata, the region of the adrenal primarily responsible for glucocorticoid production.
p4956
aVExposure to 30 mg/kg was also associated with reductions in bw and increases in liver weight.
p4957
aVTherefore, overt toxicity and stress rather than a direct effect of PFOA on immune responses were considered as potential modulating factors of immune suppression at this dose.
p4958
aVIn addition, a recently published paper suggested that alterations in lymphoid organs and IgM synthesis in mice exposed to PFOA were the result of severe overt toxicity and stress and that the immune system was not a specific target (Loveless et al., 2008).
p4959
aVTo address the potential role of elevated corticosterone production in the suite of effects previously reported (DeWitt et al., 2008),
p4960
aVwe evaluated lymphoid organ weights, T-cell\u2013dependent antibody responses, clinical serum chemistry parameters related to liver health, and serum corticosterone concentrations in sham-operated or adrenalectomized (adx) C57BL/6 mice exposed to 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg of PFOA.
p4961
aVOur objectives were to determine the influence of corticosterone on PFOA-induced immune suppression and to examine markers of liver toxicity associated with PFOA-induced changes to immune function.

aVOn the days of blood collection, movement in and out of the animal suite was limited.

aVIgM titers were determined as described previously (DeWitt et al., 2005).
p4997
aVBriefly, flatbottom 96-well Immunolon-2 ELISA microtiter plates (Dynatech Labs, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 125 \u03bcl of 2 \u03bcg/ml of SRBC membrane (1.46 mg/ml stock solution diluted in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], prepared according to Temple et al., 1995) and then incubated at 4°C for at least 16 h.

aVTriglyceride level was the only clinical serum chemistry parameter that demonstrated a statistically significant dose-dependency (Tables 1 and 2).
p5013
aVTriglyceride levels in sham animals dosed with 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg PFOA for 5 days were 44.8, 57.8, and 61.2% lower, respectively, than levels measured in sham control animals.
p5014
aVIn adx animals only the 7.5 and 15 mg/kg groups were statistically lower than the adx control animals (59.9 and 75.2%, respectively).
p5015
aVOn average, triglyceride levels were lower after ten days of exposure compared with five days of exposure, but the differences between triglyceride levels after five or ten days of exposure were not statistically significant.
p5016
aVA few other clinical chemistry parameters were statistically elevated or decreased relative to control responses, but no changes indicated a trend associated with dose, duration of exposure, or adrenalectomy (Tables 1 and 2).
p5017
aVIn general, clinical serum chemistry parameters of dosed animals did not differ statistically from those of control animals.
p5018
aVBaseline corticosterone levels in serum collected prior to dosing were 125.6 ± 59.0 ng/ml for the sham animals and 5.7 ± ng/ml for the adx animals (all adx animals were below LOD).
p5019
aVAfter 10 days of PFOA dosing, average corticosterone concentrations in sham animals were approximately 157% greater in dosed animals compared with control animals (Fig.
p5020
aV2A; only the 15 mg/kg group was statistically different from controls).
p5021
aVFive days after dosing ended, average corticosterone levels in sham animals were 73% greater in dosed animals compared with control animals (Fig.
p5022
aV2A; no groups statistically different from controls).
p5023
aVAverage corticosterone concentrations in adx animals were 27% lower in dosed animals compared with control animals after 10 days of PFOA dosing (Fig.
p5024
aV2B; no groups statistically different from controls) and within 10% of each other 5 days after dosing ended (Fig.
p5025
aV2B).
p5026
aVDosing with 15 mg/kg PFOA for 10 days reduced SRBC-specific IgM antibody titers (Fig.
p5027
aV3) by 18% relative to controls in sham animals and by 15.4% in adx animals (p &lt; 0.05).
p5028
aVDosing with 7.5 mg/kg PFOA also reduced IgM antibody titers by 11.8% relative to controls in adx animals (p &lt; 0.05).
p5029
aVThe data presented here indicate that suppression of T-cell\u2013dependent antibody responses (TDAR) in PFOA-treated mice is independent of increased serum corticosterone levels and liver toxicity as measured by clinical serum chemistries.
p5030
aVIn this study, we evaluated clinical serum chemistry parameters related to liver health, serum corticosterone levels, and TDAR in sham-operated or adx adult C57BL/6N female mice dosed with one of several concentrations of PFOA for ten days to verify corticosterone levels or changes to clinical serum chemistries as factors in suppression of IgM TDAR.
p5031
aVNone of the clinical serum chemistry parameters measured indicated a gross alteration in liver health of animals in the study.
p5032
aVDosing with 15 mg/kg of PFOA statistically reduced IgM antibody titers in both sham and adx animals and 7.5 mg/kg PFOA also reduced titers in adx animals.
p5033
aVIn addition, serum corticosterone levels were elevated in dosed animals relative to control animals in the sham group.
p5034
aVAs expected, relatively low levels of corticosterone were measured in the adx animals (16.0\u201351.9 ng/ml range).
p5035
aVYang et al.
p5036
aV(2002) evaluated the effects of PFOA on antigen-specific antibody responses and lymphocyte proliferation in response to T- or B-cell mitogens in male C57BL/6 mice fed a diet of 30 mg PFOA/kg for 15 days.
p5037
aVAntigen-specific IgM and IgG serum titers were suppressed relative to responses of unexposed animals.
p5038
aVIn a set of studies designed to corroborate the immune alterations reported by Yang et al.
p5039
aV(2002), we previously reported (DeWitt et al., 2008) suppression of IgM antibody titers in female C57BL/6 given 3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg of PFOA in drinking water.
p5040
aVAt the two lower doses, no effects on lymphoid organ weights or bw were observed.
p5041
aVHowever, at the 15 and 30 mg/kg doses, bw and lymphoid organ weights were reduced, and at the 30 mg/kg dose (in a previous study, unpublished), cytoplasmic vacuolization in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal was increased, suggesting the potential for stress-induced immune suppression from increased corticosterone production.
p5042
aVIn addition, Loveless et al.
p5043
aV(2008) reported suppression of IgM antibody titers in male CD-1 mice exposed to 10 or 30 mg/kg PFOA for 28 days, confirming our results and the results of Yang et al.
p5044
aV(2002) in another strain of mice.
p5045
aVHowever, Loveless et al.
p5046
aV(2008) asserted that these immune findings represented secondary responses to systemic toxicity and stress as indicated by bw loss and elevated serum corticosterone levels.
p5047
aVCorticosterone is a glucocorticoid that increases in response to many stressors.
p5048
aVElevated production of corticosterone is immunosuppressive, although duration of exposure to elevated levels is critical in determining the outcome.
p5049
aVThe relationship between increased corticosterone concentration and changes in immune function has been represented by the area under the curve (AUC) for serum corticosterone (Pruett, 2001, 2003; Pruett and Fan, 2001; Pruett et al., 1999, 2003, 2007).
p5050
aVThe cumulative effects of hormones on downstream functions are often evaluated by calculating the AUC, which can be thought of as total hormonal output over a given time period (Pruessner et al., 2003).
p5051
aVThe AUC concept for corticosterone illustrates the linear relationship between the duration of corticosterone elevation and suppression of certain immune parameters.
p5052
aVCirculating leukocytes, lymphoid organ weights, and changes to lymphoid organ histopathology occur at AUCs between 1380 and 4188 ng/ml/h (Pruett and Hébert, 2007).
p5053
aVHowever, antibody production, the response that we evaluated, is relatively insensitive to increases in corticosterone; Pruett and Fan (2001) reported that SRBC-specific IgG antibodies in mice were only suppressed at AUCs greater than 3000 ng/ml/h, and enhanced at lower AUCs.
p5054
aVIn the current study corticosterone was only evaluated at three time points separated by days, rather than hours, so we were not able to calculate the AUC for corticosterone.
p5055
aVHowever, we did measure serum corticosterone immediately after animals had experienced handling (restrained), injection (immunized with SRBCs), and chemical exposure (dosed with PFOA for 10 days).
p5056
aVThe highest corticosterone concentration that we measured in any mouse was 380 ng/ml.
p5057
aVIn comparison, in a study of the effects of atrazine and ethanol on stress responses in mice, peak corticosterone concentrations were 1200 and 800 ng/ml, respectively (Pruett et al., 2003),
p5058
aVwhich were two to four times the peak corticosterone levels measured in our study.
p5059
aVPruett and Fan (2001) reported that an AUC greater than 3000 ng/ml/h was necessary to reduce IgG antibody titers and Neigh et al.
p5060
aV(2004) reported that an AUC of approximately 250 ng/ml/h was necessary to reduce IgM antibody titers.
p5061
aVGiven that the average corticosterone concentrations for all of our groups were less than 200 ng/ml, it is unlikely that we achieved an AUC sufficient to reduce IgM antibody titers in our study.
p5062
aVSerum corticosterone levels associated with suppression of IgM antibody titers in CD-1 mice exposed to 30 mg/kg PFOA for 28 days were between 400 and 500 ng/ml, which were more than 200% greater than levels in control animals (Loveless et al., 2008).
p5063
aVFang et al.
p5064
aV(2008) reported increases in cortisol, changes in lymphocyte populations, and alteration in cytokines in BALB/c mice exposed to 3 or 5 mg/kg perfluorononanoic acid via gavage for 14 days.
p5065
aVIncreases in cortisol in exposed animals were approximately 50% greater relative to control animals, but concentrations were all lower than 100 ng/ml.
p5066
aVIn both of these studies, the authors suggested that the immunomodulatory effects observed were from activation of the HPA axis by the chemical under study.
p5067
aVLoveless et al.
p5068
aV(2008) suggested that the immune suppression was the result of a stress response and Fang et al.
p5069
aV(2008) suggested that the observed changes in immune parameters were associated with increases in cortisol levels.
p5070
aVOur data contradict these assertions and indicate that immunosuppression is independent of elevated corticosterone.
p5071
aVPFOA ligates the peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor alpha (PPAR-\u03b1), a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates gene expression related to lipid and glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and inflammation.
p5072
aVPPAR-\u03b1 agonists, including PFOA, have been reported to reduce inflammation induced by carageenan (Taylor et al., 2002, 2005).
p5073
aVWhen coadministered with RU-486, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) partial agonist, the anti-inflammatory effect of PFOA was not altered, indicating that GR receptors do not mediate the effects of PFOA (Taylor et al., 2005).
p5074
aVTaylor et al.
p5075
aV(2005) therefore suggested that a mechanism mediated by endogenous corticosterone release following activation of the HPA axis was not sufficient to explain PFOA's anti-inflammatory effects.
p5076
aVAlthough the involvement of the HPA axis at higher doses of fluorinated compounds is possible, it is not sufficient to explain immune suppression at lower doses or at doses where signs of generalized toxicity (i.e., loss in bw or decreased bw gain) are not evident.
p5077
aVAlthough we do not discount that overt toxicity is likely at higher doses (i.e., 15 and 30 mg/kg PFOA), where loss of bw, even when adjusted for increases in liver weight, also occurred, a stress response is insufficient to explain immune suppression at 7.5 mg/kg PFOA in the adx animals.
p5078
aVThe lack of dose-dependent changes to clinical serum chemistries also indicates that liver toxicity, as a symptom of overt toxicity, was not induced by PFOA exposure or adrenalectomy at lower doses.
p5079
aVAs glucocorticoids autoregulate GR expression, we are evaluating GR levels in livers of mice exposed to PFOA.
p5080
aVChanges in GR levels would be an indicator of PFOA-induced increases in corticosterone during the exposure period.
p5081
aVHowever, changes in GR levels would not explain the reductions in antibody synthesis we observed in the adx animals.
p5082
aVIn our previous study, female C57BL/6N mice exposed to 3.75 or 7.5 mg/kg PFOA for 15 days had suppressed IgM antibody titers but no changes in body, spleen, or thymus weights (DeWitt et al., 2008).
p5083
aVIn the current study, suppression of IgM antibody titers was observed in both sham and adx animals exposed to PFOA for 10 days.
p5084
aVAlthough these doses were associated with about 10% weight loss in the adx animals relative to controls (even after bw was adjusted for increases in liver weights), the absence of significant changes to clinical serum chemistries and low levels of corticosterone indicate that our immune findings do not represent secondary responses to systemic toxicity and stress.
p5085
aVPeden-Adams et al.
p5086
aV(2008) observed suppression of both T-cell\u2013dependent (SRBC-specific) and T-cell\u2013independent (trinitrophenyl-specific) antibody synthesis in mice exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate for 28 days.
p5087
aVNo changes in bw, lymphoid organ weights, or lymphoid cell populations were observed at the lower doses associated with immune suppression.
p5088
aVAlthough they did not measure corticosterone, Peden-Adams et al.

aVWorkers who carried the following genotypes were associated with greater frequency of MN (P &lt; 0.05 for each comparison, unless specified): XRCC1 -77 C/T genotype (FR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.57; reference C/C), ADPRT 762 Ala/Ala (FR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.17\u20132.03; P &lt; 0.01), XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp (FR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87\u20131.27; reference, Arg/Arg), XRCC1 280 Arg/His (FR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.42; reference, Arg/Arg), XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes (FR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.53 and FR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.49; reference Arg/Arg, respectively).
p5100
aVAs XRCC1 polymorphisms were linked, workers carrying the XRCC1 (-77)-(194)-(280)-(399) diplotype, TCGA/TCGA, had a higher MN frequency compared with individuals carrying the wild-type CCGG/CCGG (FR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.02\u20132.41; P &lt; 0.05).

aV1,3-Butadiene (BD) is an important industrial chemical used to manufacture synthetic rubber and other polymers.
p5104
aVIt is also a common air pollutant found in auto missions and cigarette smoke.
p5105
aVSince the recognition of BD as a potent carcinogen in mice (1), BD has been the subject of intense research.
p5106
aVThe International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified BD as a Group 1 carcinogen (2).
p5107
aVIn recent years, BD exposure research has expanded to characterize its carcinogenic risk to humans and to understand the relationships between gene polymorphisms involved in BD exposure and the mechanisms of its toxicity leading to carcinogenicity (3).
p5108
aVThere is accumulating evidence that carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of BD are due to the formation of the epoxide metabolites, butadiene monoepoxide, butadiene diepoxide and butadiene diolepoxide (4).
p5109
aVThese metabolites form DNA adducts or protein adducts which result in genetic toxicity.
p5110
aVPrevious studies found that BD metabolites can induce genetic damage including an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), chromosome aberrations (CA) and micronuclei (MN).
p5111
aVSome in vitro and animal experiments have demonstrated that the frequency of SCE and CA is increased in lymphocytes treated by butadiene monoepoxide.
p5112
aVAn epidemiologic study in 19 BD exposure workers also found a high risk of CA and SCE (5,6); yet conflicting results were reported in another study, where there was no obvious change of SCE, MN or CA even when the BD exposure concentration was in the range of 2.2\u20137.4 mg/m3 (7).
p5113
aVThese conflicting results suggest that other factors, such as polymorphic variants in DNA repair genes, may modify the effect of BD on chromosome damage.

aVX-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene products are involved in the repair of single-strand DNA breaks.
p5115
aVThe repair of single-strand DNA breaks arising directly from damage to the deoxyribose moieties or indirectly as intermediates of the base excision repair (BER) pathway (8) is facilitated by the scaffold protein XRCC1 via its ability to interact with DNA ligase III\u03b1, DNA polymerase b, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (APE1), polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerases 1 and 2 (ADPRT-1 and 2).

aVA major defense against alkylating mutations is provided by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a DNA repair protein that transfers potentially carcinogenic O6-alkylation adducts from the DNA to a cysteine residue of MGMT (9,10).

aVFor each adduct removed, an MGMT molecule is inactivated.
p5118
aVSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms of the MGMT gene have also been associated with increased risks of cancer, especially among those exposed to alkylating mutagens.
p5119
aVThe aim of the present study was to determine: (i) whether BD-exposed workers had increased chromosome damage through CB-MN methods and (ii) whether common polymorphisms in the DNA repair pathway (XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg280His, XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC1 -77T/C, MGMT Leu84Phe, ADPRT Val762Ala and APE1 Asp148Glu) modified the amount of chromosome damage in BD-exposed workers.

aVFor categorical variables, the FR indicated a proportional increase/decrease of the micronucleus frequency in a comparison group relative to the referent.
p5162
aVAll statistical analyses were done using the software SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute).
p5163
aVPHASE software (version 2.0.2) was used to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the XRCC1 haplotype frequencies.
p5164
aVAll areas of the industrial plant had detectable levels of butadiene; the PBL operational plant, specifically, had the highest concentration of all the sites.
p5165
aVThe transient concentration in PBL storage sites, operational sites and vibrating screen sites were 182.53, 1985.99, 153.35 mg/m3, respectively.
p5166
aVThe values ranged from 0.05 to 1985.99 mg/m3.
p5167
aVTable I presents the study demographics and lifestyle characteristics of the workers, along with their associations with micronucleus frequency.
p5168
aVThe percentage of male subjects, current and former smokers and alcohol drinkers were 89.8, 56.6, and 25.3%, respectively.
p5169
aVThe mean cumulative BD exposure was 587 mg/year.
p5170
aVThere was a small increase in MN frequency among women and participants who were \u226535 years of age, but this did not reach statistical difference.
p5171
aVNo significant difference in MN frequency was detected by smoking or alcohol drinking status.
p5172
aVBD-exposed workers had a mean MN frequency of (3.39 ± 2.42)\u2030 which was significantly higher than the mean MN frequency of the controls (1.48 ± 1.26)\u2030 (P &lt; 0.01).
p5173
aVWithin the workers themselves, Poisson regression demonstrated that high BD-exposed workers (&gt;587 mg/year, where 587 mg/year was the median level of exposure) had a significantly increased MN frequency compared with the low BD-exposed group (\u2264587 mg/year; FR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.14\u20131.53; P &lt; 0.01).
p5174
aVThe frequencies of APE1, ADPRT, MGMT and XRCC1 genotypes are found in Table II, and their association with chromosome damage (by CB-MN) in workers is presented in Table III.
p5175
aVThe minor (variant) alleles and their minor allele frequencies (in parentheses) were as follows: ADPRT1 762Ala (26%), MGMT 84Phe (12%) and APE1 148Glu (37%), XRCC1 194 Trp (37%), XRCC1 280 His (17%), XRCC1 399 Gln (26%) and XRCC1 -77 C/T (16%).
p5176
aVGenotype distributions at each locus were consistent with Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium.
p5177
aVNo associations with MN frequency were found with the MGMT Leu84Phe and APE1 Asp148Glu polymorphisms.
p5178
aVIn contrast, individuals carrying the ADPRT 762 Ala/Ala genotype had a significantly higher MN frequency, when compared with those carrying the Val/Val genotype (FR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.17\u20132.03; P &lt; 0.01).
p5179
aVThe XRCC1 -77 C/T genotype had a significantly higher MN frequency when compared with workers carrying the T/T genotype (FR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.57; P &lt; 0.05).
p5180
aVThere was a higher MN frequency for individuals who possessed XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp genotypes compared with those carrying the Arg/Arg genotype (FR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07\u20131.27; P &lt; 0.05).
p5181
aVXRCC1 280 His/His genotype was also associated with a significantly higher MN frequency, when compared with the Arg/Arg genotype (FR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.42; P &lt; 0.05).
p5182
aVThe XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln genotype had a significantly higher MN frequency compared with those carrying Arg/Arg genotype (FR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.53; P &lt; 0.05).
p5183
aVTable IV presents the results of multivariate analysis using a backward stepwise selection of variables, including age, sex, smoking status, alcohol drinking, cumulative BD exposure and polymorphisms of XRCC1, APE1, ADPRT and MGMT.
p5184
aVIn the final model, subjects with XRCC1 -77 C/T, ADPRT 762 C, XRCC1 194 T, XRCC1 280 A and XRCC1 399 A variant alleles (based on a dominant genetic inheritance model) each had a statistically significantly higher MN frequency, when compared with their respective wild-type homozygous counterparts.
p5185
aVHigher cumulative BD exposure was also associated with higher MN frequency.
p5186
aVTo further elucidate the relevance of XRCC1 variants with MN frequency, linkage disequilibrium among the four XRCC1 polymorphisms (XRCC1 -77 C/T, Arg194Trp, Arg280His and Arg399Gln) was analyzed and haplotypes were reconstructed.
p5187
aVThe D\u2032 value of the four loci of XRCC1 were 0.821 (XRCC1 -77 with 194), 0.842 (XRCC1 -77 with 280), 0.862 (XRCC1 -77 with 399), 0.857 (XRCC1 194 with 280), 0.814 (XRCC1 194 with 399) and 0.803 (XRCC1 280 with 399).
p5188
aVFor all subjects, 28 XRCC1 (-77)-(194)-(280)-(399) diplotypes were identified in the analysis of the workers.
p5189
aVThe diplotype CCGG/CCGG which consists of the wild-type sequence in all loci was selected as the reference.
p5190
aVAmong these haplotype pairs, the rare diplotypes (&lt;5% frequency) were analyzed as a group.
p5191
aVFRs associated with various diplotypes in all study subjects are presented in Table V.
p5192
aVBased on the individual polymorphism results, one would have expected that a CCAA haplotype should have the highest MN frequencies; however, this haplotype was extremely rare in this population and no statistical analysis could be performed.
p5193
aVCompared with individuals with wild-type CCGG/CCGG, the FR was significantly different (FR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.37; P &lt; 0.05) for the individuals with the TCGA/TCGA diplotype.
p5194
aVThe TCGA haplotype shares the same allele as CCAA at two loci: XRCC1 194 and XRCC1 399.
p5195
aVMultivariate Poisson regression adjusted by age, gender and cumulative BD exposure dose described a significantly higher MN frequency for individuals carrying the TCGA/TCGA diplotype (FR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.02\u20132.41; P &lt; 0.05).
p5196
aVBER is the predominant pathway for averting the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of damaged DNA bases generated by either endogenous or exogenous factors, including lesions that arise spontaneously due to the intrinsic instability of DNA and those that are induced by environmental chemicals.
p5197
aVThis study found that workers who were cumulatively exposed to BD at higher rates also faced a significantly higher risk of chromosome damage, when compared with less exposed workers and with unexposed controls.
p5198
aVAmong Chinese BD-exposed workers, the genotypes XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp, XRCC1 280 Arg/His, XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln, XRCC1 77 T/C and ADPRT 762Ala/Ala were each associated with increased MN frequency.
p5199
aVIn addition, workers carrying the XRCC1 TCGA/TCGA diplotype were also associated with greater chromosome damage.
p5200
aVOur exposure assessment data showed that PBL operational sites had the highest concentration.
p5201
aVSimilarly, Hayes et al.
p5202
aV(13) measured exposure levels in a butadiene polymer production facility in China, the exposure range in polymer analysts was from below detection to 2382 mg/m3.
p5203
aVMoreover, industrials exceeded exposure to butadiene in other countries were also reported (2).
p5204
aVConsistent with previous studies (14,15), our study found that there was no significant effect of smoking or alcohol drinking on MN frequency.
p5205
aVThe most plausible interpretation for this lack of association is that the magnitude of association with BD exposure was so strong that relationships with smoking or alcohol drinking were masked.
p5206
aVAlternatively, blood concentrations of cigarette smoke or alcohol-related genotoxins may have been too low to cause chromosomal damage in lymphocytes (16).
p5207
aVPrevious epidemiologic studies have investigated the effect of various lifestyle and biological factors on MN frequency in human lymphocytes.
p5208
aVThe most consistent demographic variable influencing the MN frequency was age, with MN frequency increasing significantly with age (17).
p5209
aVHowever, our results indicated that there was no significant increase in MN frequency among older workers compared with younger workers and no significant difference between female and male workers.
p5210
aVA possible reason for these findings may be the limited number of older and female workers in this study.
p5211
aVThere are &gt;60 validated genetic polymorphisms in XRCC1 and \u223c30 variants are located in exons or promoter regions.
p5212
aVThe most extensively studied polymorphisms are Arg194Trp on exon 6, Arg280His on exon 9 and Arg399Gln on exon 10 (18).
p5213
aVIn our study, the exposed workers carrying XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp and Trp/Trp genotypes had statistically higher MN frequency, when compared with workers carrying the XRCC1 194Arg/Arg wild-type genotype.
p5214
aVThe XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp polymorphism is located in the XRCC1 nuclear localization signal domain, in proximity to other domains that mediate polymerase \u03b2 and APE1 interactions (19).
p5215
aVTherefore, this polymorphism may disturb XRCC1 protein conformation, resulting in a decreased protein affinity or decreased DNA damage binding and ineffective DNA repair.
p5216
aVZhu et al.
p5217
aV(20) and Zhang et al.
p5218
aV(21) reported that this polymorphism significantly decreased DNA damage repair in vinyl chloride monomer and benzene-exposed workers, respectively.
p5219
aVIn our study, BD-exposed workers carrying the XRCC1 280 Arg/His and His/His genotypes were found to carry a higher chromosome damage than other who did not carry these genotypes.
p5220
aVPrevious research that investigated XRCC1 polymorphisms and their association with DNA repair capacity reported that only the variant proteins associated with the XRCC1 280 His allele is defective in the efficient localization of the protein to a damaged site in the chromosome, thereby reducing BER efficiency (22).
p5221
aVBecause XRCC1 Arg280His is located close to sequences that mediate protein\u2013protein interactions with ADPRT and DNA polymerase \u03b2 (23\u201325), this protein may be involved in the formation of unstable chromosomal aberrations (26).
p5222
aVSeveral studies (27\u201329) have found an association between the presence of the variant genotypes of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and reduced DNA repair capacity, including data showing increased MN frequency.
p5223
aVThree studies (30\u201332) all reported a significant increase in CA frequency in the presence of a variant allele of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism in benzene-exposed workers.
p5224
aVHowever, others have reported no detrimental effect of variant XRCC1 399 Gln allele and XRCC1-mediated repair (33\u201336).
p5225
aVIn our study, worker exposed to BD and carrying the XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes had higher chromosome damage compared with workers carrying the Arg/Arg genotype.
p5226
aVHao et al.
p5227
aV(37) first reported the identification and association of genetic variants in XRCC1 -T77C and their associations with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
p5228
aVThe C-allele-containing promoter has greater Sp1-binding affinity (38).
p5229
aVIn our study, the XRCC1 -T77C polymorphism was associated with MN frequency in BD exposure workers.
p5230
aVThis finding is consistent with previous studies, which have reported an association between XRCC1 -T77C polymorphisms and lung cancer development in Northern and Southern Chinese populations (39,40).
p5231
aVA haplotype is a group of several polymorphisms in close physical proximity to each other (and on same chromosome) that have a tendency to be inherited with little genetic recombination.
p5232
aVThe association study based on the haplotype may have an increased power to detect disease associations compared with analysis of single polymorphisms (41).
p5233
aVLinkage disequilibrium analysis of XRCC1 found that the four polymorphisms of XRCC1 (-C77T, Arg194Trp, Arg280His and Arg399Gln) are in linkage disequilibrium,
p5234
aVand this is in agreement with Brem et al.
p5235
aV(38).
p5236
aVOur results found a nominally higher FR for the XRCC1 TCGA/TCGA diplotype (compared with the reference wild-type diplotype) than with individual XRCC1 polymorphisms.
p5237
aVOther studies have also suggested that XRCC1 haplotypes may be appropriate for assessing environment disease associations.
p5238
aVFor instance, Leng et al.
p5239
aV(42) reported that XRCC1 haplotypes are associated with risk of chromosomal damage in Chinese coke-oven workers.
p5240
aVSuch a statistically significant association may be attributable to changes in XRCC1 function because the DNA repair capacity of mutant alleles was lower than that of wild-type alleles.
p5241
aVHowever, no studies to date have confirmed that these diplotypes are more strongly associated with altered XRCC1 activity than the individual polymorphisms.
p5242
aVIf confirmed, XRCC1 diplotypes may be useful in future occupational health surveillance as markers to screen and monitor workers who are occupationally exposed to BD.
p5243
aVADPRT1 is a nuclear protein that binds to DNA via zinc-finger motifs (43).
p5244
aVADPRT1-deficient mice were susceptible to carcinoma, when induced by certain gene toxic agents (44,45).
p5245
aVThe ADPRT1 polymorphism evaluated in this study, located within the COOH-terminal catalytic domain, has been associated with the risk of thyroid carcinoma, carcinoma of gastric cardia and smoking-related lung cancer (46,47).
p5246
aVA functional study had reported that the at-risk variant allele exhibited a 40% reduction in enzyme activity that resulted in a subsequent reduction in BER capacity.
p5247
aVThis reduction in capacity may lead to genome instability associated with the increased risk of tumor development (48).
p5248
aVOur study expands on these consistent results by reporting that the at-risk genotype in these other studies also correspond to higher MN frequency in BD-exposed workers, well before cancer development.
p5249
aVGenetic polymorphisms are common in the general population.
p5250
aVMost polymorphisms are located outside gene boundaries and thus thought not to have any apparent effects on protein functions.
p5251
aVIf a polymorphism is within the coding region of a gene, amino acid substitution may occur and result in change of protein activity, whereas polymorphisms in the promoter will alter the efficiency of transcription and polymorphisms located at an intron or exon boundary in a gene may produce incorrect messenger RNA splicing, which results in incomplete or inactive proteins.
p5252
aVThus, in this study, although no association of polymorphisms in APE1 Asp148Glu and MGMT1 Leu84Phe with risk of BD exposed was found, other polymorphisms in the promoter and coding region of these genes, yet to be identified, may contribute to risk of BD exposure.
p5253
aVIn conclusion, our results reported that BD-exposed workers had higher frequencies of MN compared with controls, a result that indicates a pronounced clastogenicity of BD.
p5254
aVThe XRCC1 -T77C, XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp, XRCC1 280 Arg/His, XRCC1 399 Arg/Gln, ADPRT 762 Ala/Ala genotypes and XRCC1 TCGA/TCGA diplotype were each associated with higher levels of DNA damage among Chinese workers exposed to BD.
p5255
aVThese DNA repair polymorphism results may have important implications for mechanisms of carcinogenesis.
p5256
aVIn order to understand better the mechanisms of BD-induced genotoxicity and ultimately carcinogenicity, it is important to evaluate additional variants of genes that participate in the metabolic pathway of BD.
p5257
aVParticular attention should be paid to identify genetic markers as well as gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interaction that may predict individual susceptibility to genetic damage.
p5258
aVCellular responses to carcinogens are typically studied in transformed cell lines, which do not reflect the physiological status of normal tissues.
p5259
aVTo address this question, we have characterized the transcriptional program and cellular responses of human lung WI-38 fibroblasts upon exposure to the ultimate carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE).
p5260
aVIn contrast to observations in cell lines, we find that BPDE treatment induces a strong inflammatory response in these normal fibroblasts.
p5261
aVWhole-genome microarrays show induction of numerous inflammatory factors, including genes that encode interleukins (ILs), growth factors and enzymes related to prostaglandin synthesis and signaling.
p5262
aVReal-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed a time- and dose-dependent-induced expression and production of cyclooxygenase 2, prostglandin E2 and IL1B, IL6 and IL8.
p5263
aVIn parallel, cell cycle progression and DNA repair processes were repressed, but DNA damage signaling was increased via p53-Ser15 phosphorylation and induced expression levels of GADD45A, CDKN1A, BTG2 and SESN1.
p5264
aVNetwork analysis suggested that activator protein 1 transcription factors may link the cell cycle response and DNA damage signaling with the inflammatory stress\u2013response in these cells.
p5265
aVWe confirmed this hypothesis by showing that p53-dependent signaling through c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) led to increased cJun-Ser63 phosphorylation and that inhibition of JNK-mediated cJun activation using p53- or JNK-specific inhibitors significantly reduced IL gene expression and subsequent production of IL8.
p5266
aVThis is the first demonstration that a strong inflammatory response is triggered in normal fibroblasts by BPDE and that this occurs through coordinated regulation with other cellular processes.
p5267
aVCigarette smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer and the lung inflammatory diseases emphysema and chronic bronchitis (1,2).
p5268
aVPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the many chemical components found in cigarette smoke that induce tumor formation and inflammation in experimental animals, supporting the notion that they play a significant role as etiological agents in human disease (3).
p5269
aVIn fact, the International Agency for Research on Cancer reports that \u223c15% of the carcinogenic compounds found in cigarette smoke are PAHs (1); hence, the PAHs most probably contribute to the etiology of cancers associated with the well-known correlation between tobacco smoke and lung cancer (4).
p5270
aVPAHs are readily metabolized to water-soluble compounds in a process that produces carcinogenic diol epoxide (DE) intermediates that react with nucleic acids, producing covalently modified bases in the genome (5).
p5271
aVIn the case of high levels of PAH\u2013DNA lesions, p53-associated responses block the cell cycle, providing an opportunity for the DNA repair machinery to restore genome integrity or direct the cell to undergo apoptosis (6\u20139).
p5272
aVPAHs also activate production of inflammatory mediators through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent pathway, either directly or by downstream activation of phosphorylation-mediated signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinases that further stimulate stress-responsive transcription factors (10\u201312).
p5273
aVFrequent exposure to agents that damage DNA can lead to chronic inflammation that has been linked to the progression of several pathological conditions, including cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and cancer (13,14).
p5274
aVGene profiling studies on PAH DE in different cell types, including normal epithelial cells and carcinoma cell lines, have been reported to show alterations in the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair and p53 pathways (15\u201322).
p5275
aVHowever, the genome-wide response of lung fibroblasts to PAHs has not been studied.
p5276
aVLung fibroblasts confer structural support to the lung's connective tissue and play a role in stimulating and amplifying inflammatory signals, including those that arise as responses to cigarette smoke (23).
p5277
aVTo examine this, we exposed normal human WI-38 lung fibroblasts to three different concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE).
p5278
aVUsing whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays to measure changes in gene expression, we found strong induction of genes involved in inflammatory response and parallel alterations in processes related to cell cycle regulation and DNA repair.
p5279
aVTo identify the essential signaling events that mediate these responses, we performed directed assays of key members of multiple pathways to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels and to assess their activation status.
p5280
aVThese experiments revealed that the mechanism underlying the response of normal lung fibroblasts to BPDE involves the coordinated regulation of multiple signaling pathways.
p5281
aVRacemic anti-BPDE [(±)-7r,8t-dihydroxy-9t,10t-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro benzo[a]pyrene] was obtained from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository (Kansas City, MO).

aVThis set was supplemented by genes/proteins identified as being involved in the response to BPDE in the current study (supplementary Table S6 is available at Carcinogenesis Online), resulting in 153 proteins.
p5324
aVThis core network was supplemented with direct interactors (local 1-hop neighbors) from Human Protein Reference Database, resulting in 1339 proteins with 7778 interactions.
p5325
aVIn Figure 6, the network was reduced to only include significantly changed genes together with the supplemented nodes.
p5326
aVTo develop more specific response networks, three separate cell cycle, DNA repair and stress\u2013response subnetworks with 121, 89 and 147 proteins, respectively, were created (found in supplementary Figures S4\u2013S6, available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5327
aVTo test the effects of a PAH DE on lung fibroblasts, we used oligonucleotide microarrays representing &gt;38 000 well-characterized human genes to measure gene expression in WI-38 cells exposed to 0.1, 0.5 or 1 \u03bcM BPDE for 24 h.
p5328
aVWe note that exposure to 1 \u03bcM BPDE for 24 or 48 h led to a 20% decrease in viability, whereas lower doses of BPDE (0.1 and 0.01 \u03bcM) were minimally cytotoxic with a &lt;10% decrease in viability (supplementary Figure S1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5329
aVDetection call filtering followed by SAM identified 1332 genes whose expression was significantly changed following exposure to at least one concentration of BPDE when compared with control cells (supplementary Table S1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5330
aVA significant change in gene expression was defined as \u22652-fold change in expression with &lt;10% false discovery rate (FDR).
p5331
aVExposure to 0.1, 0.5 or 1 \u03bcM BPDE resulted in 384, 972 and 837 differentially expressed genes, respectively (Figure 1A).
p5332
aVOf these, 37 genes were upregulated and 151 genes were downregulated in response to all doses of BPDE.
p5333
aVHierarchical clustering revealed a significant similarity in responses induced by the two higher doses when compared with the lower dose of 0.1 \u03bcM BPDE (supplementary Figure S2, is available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5334
aVTo elucidate the fundamental cellular processes affected in WI-38 cells following exposure to BPDE, we examined functional annotations of genes with significant changes in expression using GO Biological Process terms (written in italic).
p5335
aVDownregulated genes were mainly involved in mitosis, cell cycle checkpoints, spindle organization and biogenesis, DNA replication and DNA repair, among others.
p5336
aVUpregulated genes were involved in nucleosome assembly, cell proliferation and extracellular processes such as cell\u2013cell signaling and stress, inflammatory and immune responses.
p5337
aVBoth negative and positive regulators of proliferation were among the induced genes involved in cell proliferation; induced expression of cytokines and growth factors were mainly responsible for the effect on cell\u2013cell signaling and the stress\u2013responses and the effect on nucleosome assembly was principally a function of upregulation of histone genes.
p5338
aVA complete accounting of significantly affected GO terms and associated genes are provided in supplementary Figure S3 and Table S2 (available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5339
aVTo identify dose-dependent effects of BPDE on gene expression, we analyzed GO functional annotations for gene clusters in Figure 1A.
p5340
aVNucleosome assembly and metabolism were positively affected by all three BPDE concentrations, but stress, inflammatory and immune response processes were only upregulated following exposure to 0.5 or 1 \u03bcM BPDE.
p5341
aVAll three BPDE doses led to downregulation of processes related to the cell cycle and intracellular organization (i.e.
p5342
aVcytoskeleton and chromosome organization).
p5343
aVThese results indicate that the threshold dose of BPDE required to produce an inflammatory response is higher than that required to shut down cell cycle related processes in lung fibroblasts.
p5344
aVWhile microarray results showed that genes involved in DNA damage repair were generally downregulated, WI-38 cells are capable of repairing DNA adducts formed by BPDE in a biphasic manner, with \u223c50% of the adducts removed within 6 h following exposure (K.Dreij, N.E.Geacintov and D.A.Scicchitano, unpublished results).
p5345
aVThis is in agreement with earlier studies looking at repair of DNA adducts derived from BPDE in cellular systems (24,33).
p5346
aVTwo genes directly involved in DNA repair were induced by BPDE: RRM2B (encoding ribonucleotide reductase RIR2B) and POLG2 (encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase accessory subunit DPOG2).
p5347
aVIn addition, exposure to 0.5 or 1 \u03bcM BPDE significantly induced genes whose products are involved in suppressing cell proliferation and the cell cycle in response to DNA damage, including BTG2, SESN1, CDKN1A and GADD45A.
p5348
aVTo confirm and extend our microarray results, we used a real-time reverse transcription (RT2)\u2013polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array covering 84 genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair to study the effects of BPDE on their expression in more detail.
p5349
aVSince the two higher doses induced similar overall expression responses based on microarray data,
p5350
aVwe extended the range of exposure to 0.01, 0.1 and 1 \u03bcM BPDE for 6, 24 and 48 h.
p5351
aVThe results revealed both time- and dose-dependent downregulation of expression, with 22 genes significantly downregulated (\u22652-fold and P &lt; 0.05; supplementary Table S3 is available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5352
aVConsistent with microarray results, only BTG2 and GADD45A were upregulated in response to 1 \u03bcM BPDE; these showed increased expression by 6 h and sustained levels of induction up to 48 h posttreatment.
p5353
aV(Lower doses did not affect their expression levels significantly.)
p5354
aVAlthough the RT2\u2013PCR showed a more pronounced effect the overall results were in good agreement with the microarray analysis (Figure 1B).
p5355
aVBPDE's most striking effect on gene expression in WI-38 cells was the upregulation of genes involved in cell\u2013cell signaling, the immune response and the inflammatory response.
p5356
aVAmong the induced genes were ILs 6, 8 and 11; matrix metallopeptidases 1, 3 and 10; growth factors BMP2, FGF9 and GDF15 and genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis and its regulation, COX2, PTGES and EDN1.
p5357
aVDue to the physiological importance of IL8 and the COX2-driven prostaglandins (PGE2) as regulators of inflammatory signaling, we performed a more in-depth analysis of the time\u2013response and dose\u2013response of IL8 and COX2 using both RT2\u2013PCR and ELISA.
p5358
aVIn RT2\u2013PCR assays, COX2 mRNA was repressed during the first 6 h after BPDE exposure, followed by induced expression at 24 and 48 h; however, only the two highest BPDE doses led to extensive upregulation, with a maximal 15-fold increase in mRNA at 24 and 48 h (Figure 2A).
p5359
aVThis result was consistent with the microarray results, which likewise showed a significant increase in COX2 mRNA only at the two higher doses (3.9-fold and 12.8-fold, respectively).
p5360
aVPGE2 levels measured by ELISA also increased over time, consistent with microarray and RT2\u2013PCR results.
p5361
aVThe highest concentration of extracellular PGE2 was detected from cells exposed to 0.1 \u03bcM BPDE at 24 h (3.7-fold increase, P &lt; 0.05; Figure 2C).
p5362
aVExposure to the highest dose of BPDE (1 \u03bcM) led to a slower response that peaked after 48 h (4.4-fold increase, P &lt; 0.05).
p5363
aVThis elevation in extracellular PGE2 was not due to an increase in the amount of enzyme responsible for its synthesis since western blot analysis using antibodies against prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (prostaglandin H2, encoded by COX2) showed no increase in protein levels (data not shown).
p5364
aVIn the case of IL8, RT2\u2013PCR assays showed a soaring 309-fold elevation in mRNA levels at 24 h followed by a 44.5-fold elevation at 48 h after exposure to 1 \u03bcM BPDE when compared with DMSO controls (all P &lt; 0.05; Figure 2B).
p5365
aVMicroarray results displayed a parallel but less dramatic pattern, with significantly increased expression at 24 h of 11.2-fold and 41.9-fold in response to 0.5 and 1 \u03bcM BPDE, respectively.
p5366
aVExtracellular IL8 protein levels were also significantly elevated in response to BPDE treatment as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D).
p5367
aVExposure to 1 \u03bcM BPDE produced the largest effect on IL8 excretion, displaying maximum levels of \u223c5-fold over control (P &lt; 0.05) after 48 h.
p5368
aVA secretory phenotype consisting of increased signaling of inflammatory mediators has been associated with senescence in response to genotoxic stress in normal human fibroblasts (34).
p5369
aVTo test whether the increased signaling of inflammatory mediators in this study was coupled with senescence, exposed cells were stained for senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (25).
p5370
aVThe highest dose of BPDE (1 \u03bcM) induced senescence in a very low number of cells (\u22644%),
p5371
aVindicating that the observed increase in signaling of inflammatory mediators was not related to senescence (supplementary Table S4 is available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5372
aVTo identify the regulatory pathways responsible for gene expression changes in WI-38 cells following BPDE exposure, we measured levels and activation status of p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins, including phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15,
p5373
aVwhich is mediated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related in response to DNA damage and promotes activation of p53-dependent pathways (35,36).
p5374
aVAs expected, we observed an increase in both p53 protein levels and phosphorylation of Ser15 after 24 and 48 h exposure to 0.5 and 1 \u03bcM BPDE, but not at 6 h (Figure 3A and B).
p5375
aVThe lower dose of 0.1 \u03bcM BPDE resulted in increased levels of p53 protein, but no detectable Ser15 phosphorylation, after 24 h. JNK protein levels remained constant after exposing WI-38 cells to BPDE, but increased JNK Thr183/Tyr185 phosphorylation was detected beginning 1 h after treatment (Figure 3A) and was observed up to 24 and 48 h after exposure to 0.5 and 1 \u03bcM BPDE (Figure 3B).
p5376
aVPhosphorylation status of ERK and p38 was basically unaffected (Figure 3A).
p5377
aVWe further investigated whether the signaling through JNK was p53-dependent and would therefore result in downstream activation of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor cJun.
p5378
aVIndeed, pretreatment of WI-38 cells with PFT-\u03b1 and JNKi\u2014which inhibit p53 and JNK (37\u201340)\u2014strongly reduced signaling through JNK and cJun (Ser63), respectively (Figure 4A).
p5379
aVBased on densitometric analysis, the inhibitors did not affect the extent of JNK and cJun phosphorylation at 6 h. However, signaling was significantly reduced at the later time points, displaying &gt;2-fold reduction of phosphorylation for both JNK and cJun at 48 h (39 ± 6% and 42 ± 10%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05; Figure 4B).
p5380
aVWe next studied the effect of interrupted p53 and JNK signaling on COX2 and ILs 1B, 6 and 8 signaling using RT2\u2013PCR and ELISA.
p5381
aVBPDE induction of COX2 mRNA remained the same or increased when cells were pretreated with JNKi and PFT-\u03b1 (Figure 5A).
p5382
aVIn contrast, inhibition of p53 and JNK significantly reduced the induction of IL mRNA levels in response to BPDE treatment.
p5383
aVWhile IL8 expression still was induced in WI-38 cells treated with inhibitor plus BPDE, mRNA levels were significantly lower compared with cells exposed to BPDE alone at 24 and 48 h (P &lt; 0.05; Figure 5A).
p5384
aVBlocking the signaling through p53 and JNK significantly reduced mRNA levels of IL1B at 24 and 48 h (P &lt; 0.05), similarly the expression of IL6 was significantly reduced by JNKi at 6 h and by both inhibitors at 24 h (P &lt; 0.05).
p5385
aVPretreatment with inhibitor also resulted in a significant reduction of extracellular IL protein levels,
p5386
aVfurther confirming their negative effect on IL signaling: in the presence of either PFT-\u03b1 or JNKi,
p5387
aVextracellular IL8 was reduced to the same level as controls at 24 and 48 h (Figure 5B).
p5388
aVThese results clearly show that signaling through p53 and JNK plays a major role in the induction of IL expression and signaling in response to BPDE treatment of normal lung fibroblasts.
p5389
aVFibroblasts synthesize and maintain stromal support for most renewable epithelial tissue, including the lungs, where they modulate the inflammatory response to many inhaled agents such as cigarette smoke that contains a wide array of PAHs (23).
p5390
aVMoreover, lung fibroblasts metabolize PAHs to DEs, leading to the formation of PAH\u2013DNA adducts (7).
p5391
aVThe studies reported here using genome-wide expression analysis show that BPDE, the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of the PAH benzo[a]pyrene (BP), induces a dose-dependent inflammatory response in normal human lung fibroblasts that operates parallel to downregulation of DNA repair and cell cycle progression.
p5392
aVFurthermore, BPDE induces the activation of JNK, which in turn increases the expression of several ILs.
p5393
aVAbrogation of the JNK pathway using p53- and JNK-specific inhibitors dramatically reduces gene expression and subsequent production of ILs 1B, 6 and 8.
p5394
aVThis is the first time such a strong inflammatory response has been observed in response to a PAH DE in human lung fibroblasts.
p5395
aVWhile cellular inflammatory responses to cigarette smoke and PAHs such as BP have been reported, there are important differences in how inflammation is mediated upon exposure to a DE metabolite like BPDE.
p5396
aVFirst, inflammatory responses to BP and other PAHs are mediated through aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent signaling (10\u201312).
p5397
aVBPDE interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to less extent and is furthermore a poor inducer of downstream metabolic events because of its short intracellular half-life compared with BP (41).
p5398
aVFurthermore, PAH metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) or aldo\u2013keto reductase generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are known to induce inflammatory responses (42\u201344);
p5399
aVhowever, BPDE does not contribute to ROS production (44,45).
p5400
aVThe analysis reported here supports the limited contribution of ROS to the BPDE inflammatory response.
p5401
aVTranscriptional changes in processes related to ROS or oxidative stress remain unaffected by BPDE treatment, whereas the parent PAH BP induces the expression of genes related to the response to ROS and oxidative stress (46).
p5402
aVConsequently, BPDE should induce inflammatory responses by pathways that operate independently from those induced by ROS.
p5403
aVIncreases in ILs are implicated in the development of several diseases related to inflammation, including the progression of lung cancer (reviewed in ref.
p5404
aV47).
p5405
aVThis may be important since IL8 expression in normal bronchial and amnion epithelial cells increases in response to BPDE (20,22).
p5406
aVHowever, the intracellular signaling pathways regulating the induction of IL expression in response to BPDE have not been reported.
p5407
aVThe results presented here show that increased IL signaling mediates the inflammatory response in human lung fibroblasts following exposure to BPDE.
p5408
aVFurthermore, the response is regulated through a pathway that includes p53 and JNK, leading to transactivation of cJun.
p5409
aVOur data also show that concomitant induction of COX2 in these cells leads to increased prostaglandin production independently of regulation through p53 and JNK.
p5410
aVThese results are consistent with the findings that BPDE-induced COX2 expression is mediated through nuclear factor-kappaB signaling in mouse epidermal cells and rat astrocytes (48,49).
p5411
aVHigh expression levels of COX2 and the formation of prostaglandins are implicated in cancer development.
p5412
aVHence, it is not necessarily surprising that COX2 inhibitors are associated with lowering the risk of certain cancers, including colorectal cancer (50).
p5413
aVTo extend our analysis and visualize the results for WI-38 fibroblast exposure to BPDE, we used publicly available data to construct an in silico protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network for annotated genes whose expression was most affected by BPDE.
p5414
aVThese included primarily genes related to the cell cycle, DNA repair and stress\u2013response (Figure 6; supplementary Figures S4\u2013S6 is available at Carcinogenesis Online).
p5415
aVFor the cell cycle network, genes involved in replication and mitosis were downregulated and genes that inhibit G1/S and G2/M transitions were upregulated in our experiments.
p5416
aVThese aggregate changes result in an overall slowing or arresting of cell cycle progression,
p5417
aVwhich is consistent with previous reports (16,19,21,22).
p5418
aVCellular responses to DNA damage are frequently mediated through pausing or stalling the cell cycle, allowing time for repair or permitting apoptosis or senescence to occur when damage is extensive.
p5419
aVNonetheless, in WI-38 lung fibroblasts exposed to BPDE, most genes involved in DNA repair are generally downregulated or relatively unaffected (Figure 6),
p5420
aVwhich is consistent with results in other BPDE-exposed cells (17\u201319).
p5421
aVFor nucleotide excision repair, which is the main DNA repair pathway that operates on PAH-damaged DNA, the primary regulatory mechanism may well involve rapid posttranslational modifications and PPIs as opposed to altered transcription (51).
p5422
aVSeveral stress\u2013response mediators found in the PPI network (Figure 6) physically interact with factors related to the cell cycle and DNA repair, including GADD45B and the AP-1 family members ATF3 and FOS.
p5423
aVActivation of AP-1 occurs through increased expression of FOS and the phosphorylation of cJun (52).
p5424
aVThe Fos\u2013Jun complex binds DNA with high affinity and induces the expression of many of the inflammatory mediators in this network, including the ILs, thus connecting the cell cycle and DNA repair with the stress\u2013response through transcriptional regulation (not represented in the PPI network) (53).
p5425
aVThe data reported here emphasize that caution should be used in extrapolating results from transformed cells to normal cells following exposure to DNA damaging agents.
p5426
aVThe strong inflammatory response observed in normal lung fibroblasts after BPDE exposure agrees with findings from genome-wide studies of other normal human cell types (20,22).
p5427
aVHowever, these results are in contrast with transformed or carcinoma cell lines which exhibit a much less pronounced upregulation of inflammatory mediators (18,19,21).
p5428
aVSimilarly, changes in histone gene expression in response to BPDE from this and other studies show induction in normal cells and repression in carcinoma cell lines (19\u201322).
p5429
aVThese differences are not unique to BPDE since gene expression responses related to CYP450 metabolism, cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis signaling also differ between normal and corresponding transformed cells following ultraviolet B irradiation and exposure to cigarette smoke condensate (54,55).
p5430
aVCell senescence is one of the many mechanisms that an organism employs for tumor suppression in response to genotoxic exposure (56).
p5431
aVMoreover, senescence leads to increased secretion of inflammatory mediators (34).
p5432
aVIn fact, the addition of antioxidants diminishes senescence in ultraviolet B and bisulfan-treated cells (57,58), which provides persuasive evidence that ROS are involved in triggering senescence.
p5433
aVWI-38 lung fibroblasts display a similar secretory phenotype in response to BPDE exposure, but there is no associated significant increase in senescence due to the fact that BPDE does not participate in the production of ROS.
p5434
aVThis supports the findings that oxidative stress and the formation of ROS are important contributing factors in activating senescence signaling in response to DNA damage.
p5435
aVIn conclusion, the studies reported here show that PAH DEs contribute to inflammatory responses in fibroblasts, independent of senescence and any metabolic byproducts such as ROS that are made during biotransformation of the parent PAH to the ultimate carcinogenic DE.
p5436
aVTherefore, our current study shows that PAH DEs cannot only induce carcinogenesis through the formation of DNA damage but also by activating intracellular and intercellular signaling, inducing tumor-promoting inflammation.
p5437
aVThese results have important implications concerning the stromal\u2013epithelial interactions in lung cancer development as a result of PAH exposure.
p5438
aVBackground: Asbestos induces DNA and chromosomal damage, but the DNA repair pathways protecting human cells against its genotoxicity are largely unknown.
p5439
aVPolymorphisms in XRCC1 have been associated with altered susceptibility to asbestos-related diseases.
p5440
aVHowever, it is unclear whether oxidative DNA damage repaired by XRCC1 contributes to asbestos-induced chromosomal damage.
p5441
aVObjectives: We sought to examine the importance of XRCC1 in protection against genotoxic effects of crocidolite and Libby amphibole asbestos.
p5442
aVMethods: We developed a genetic model of XRCC1 deficiency in human lung epithelial H460 cells and evaluated genotoxic responses to carcinogenic fibers (crocidolite asbestos, Libby amphibole) and nongenotoxic materials (wollastonite, titanium dioxide).
p5443
aVResults: XRCC1 knockdown sensitized cells to the clastogenic and cytotoxic effects of oxidants [hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), bleomycin] but not to the nonoxidant paclitaxel.
p5444
aVXRCC1 knockdown strongly enhanced genotoxicity of amphibole fibers as evidenced by elevated formation of clastogenic micronuclei.
p5445
aVCrocidolite induced primarily clastogenic micronuclei, whereas Libby amphibole induced both clastogenic and aneugenic micronuclei.
p5446
aVCrocidolite and bleomycin were potent inducers of nuclear buds, which were enhanced by XRCC1 deficiency.
p5447
aVLibby amphibole and H2O2 did not induce nuclear buds, irrespective of XRCC1 status.
p5448
aVCrocidolite and Libby amphibole similarly activated the p53 pathway.
p5449
aVConclusions: Oxidative DNA damage repaired by XRCC1 (oxidized bases, single-strand breaks) is a major cause of chromosomal breaks induced by crocidolite and Libby amphibole.
p5450
aVNuclear buds are a novel biomarker of genetic damage induced by exposure to crocidolite asbestos, which we suggest are associated with clustered DNA damage.
p5451
aVThese results provide mechanistic evidence for the epidemiological association between XRCC1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to asbestos-related disease.
p5452
aVPathways involved in the repair of asbestos-induced DNA damage are largely unknown, but XRCC1 polymorphisms that may influence the efficacy of DNA repair have been associated with susceptibility to asbestos-related diseases.
p5453
aVPietruska et al.
p5454
aV(p. 1707) examined the role of XRCC1 in genotoxic effects of crocidolite and Libby amphibole asbestos in normal and XRCC1-deficient human lung epithelial H460 cells.
p5455
aVThe authors report that oxidative DNA damage, including oxidized bases and single-strand breaks, was increased following asbestos exposure in XRCC1-deficient cells compared with control cells, and was a major cause of chromosomal breaks induced by crocidolite and Libby amphibole.
p5456
aVNuclear buds, a possible marker of clustered DNA damage, were induced by crocidolite asbestos but not Libby amphibole.
p5457
aVThe authors conclude that their findings provide mechanistic support for epidemiologic evidence linking XRCC1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to asbestos-related disease.
p5458
aVOccupational and environmental exposure to asbestos is strongly associated with the development of asbestosis, lung cancer, and malignant mesothelioma.
p5459
aVAsbestos acts in part as a genotoxic carcinogen, inducing mutations and gross chromosomal damage (Dopp et al.
p5460
aV1995; Shukla et al.
p5461
aV2003).
p5462
aVAsbestos induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (Shukla et al.
p5463
aV2003), DNA strand breaks (Jaurand 1997), and oxidized bases, including the premutagenic lesion 8-hydroxy-2´-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) (Unfried et al.
p5464
aV2002; Xu et al.
p5465
aV1999).
p5466
aVThe genotoxic effects of asbestos fibers are largely attributed to the participation of surface redox-active iron in Fenton reactions that generate ROS (Upadhyay and Kamp 2003).
p5467
aVThe presence of surface iron correlates with induction of DNA strand breaks in acellular systems, and asbestos-induced DNA damage is prevented by iron chelators and antioxidants in cultured cells (Upadhyay and Kamp 2003).
p5468
aVAlthough the DNA repair pathways activated by asbestos are largely unknown, the spectrum of DNA damage induced by asbestos suggests a role for single-strand breaks (SSBs) in asbestos-induced genotoxicity.
p5469
aVXRCC1 (X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1) is essential for successful SSB repair (Caldecott 2003).
p5470
aVSSB resolution is critical for viability, because XRCC1-knockout mice die in utero due to accumulation of endogenous DNA damage (Tebbs et al.
p5471
aV1999).
p5472
aVXRCC1 has no known enzymatic activity but is thought to function as a molecular scaffold to recruit and stabilize DNA repair proteins at the sites of SSBs.
p5473
aVXRCC1 also plays a role in removal of oxidized DNA bases, including 8-oxodG, via base excision repair (BER) (Tudek 2007).
p5474
aVXRCC1 mutations have not been identified in human tumors, but XRCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence cancer susceptibility by altering the efficacy of DNA repair.
p5475
aVPolymorphic XRCC1 variants may also alter susceptibility to asbestos-induced diseases, because substitution of glutamine for arginine at codon 399 (Arg399Gln) has been associated with elevated DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of asbestos-exposed workers (Zhao et al.
p5476
aV2006) and elevated risk of asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma (Dianzani et al.
p5477
aV2006; Neri et al.
p5478
aV2008).
p5479
aVAlthough the mechanistic basis for these associations is unknown, individuals carrying polymorphic XRCC1 variants may exhibit reduced DNA repair activity and thus may be predisposed to the accumulation of DNA damage.
p5480
aVTo date, no genetic model has been developed to address the role of oxidative damage in asbestos-induced genotoxicity or the role of XRCC1 in protecting human cells from asbestos-induced damage.
p5481
aVIt is plausible that XRCC1 is involved in repair of asbestos- induced DNA damage because asbestos induces multiple DNA lesions that are repaired by XRCC1-dependent pathways.
p5482
aVAdditionally, two types of chromosomal damage induced by asbestos\u2014micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges\u2014are specifically elevated by XRCC1 deficiency in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Qu et al.
p5483
aV2005; Thompson et al.
p5484
aV1982).
p5485
aVLast, asbestos increases activity of key BER enzymes in vitro, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and AP endonuclease 1 (Fung et al.
p5486
aV1998; Kamp et al.
p5487
aV2001).
p5488
aVIn order to test whether XRCC1 protects lung epithelial cells from asbestos-induced DNA damage, we developed a genetic model of XRCC1 deficiency in human H460 cells.
p5489
aVWe evaluated the effect of XRCC1 knockdown on genotoxicity using noncarcinogenic fibers (wollastonite) and particles [titanium dioxide (TiO2)] and two types of amphibole asbestos, International Union Against Cancer (UICC) crocidolite and Libby amphibole.
p5490
aVLibby amphibole is a mixture of noncommercial amphiboles obtained from the vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana.

aVMicronuclei were scored as centromere negative (clastogenic) or centromere positive (aneugenic) based on the presence of CREST staining, which recognizes centromere proteins within the kinetochore of each chromosome, within each micronucleus.
p5541
aVWe performed the micronucleus/CREST assay in the absence of a cytokinesis block because recent work has shown equivalent micronucleus formation in the presence and absence of cytochalasin B (Lorge et al.

aVH460 cells have an intact DNA damage response (Zhang et al.

p5554
aV2009; Reynolds and Zhitkovich 2007).
p5555
aVBecause previous studies indicated that the oxidative, clastogenic, and cytotoxic effects of asbestos fibers require internalization (Liu et al.
p5556
aV2000), we verified that H460 cells internalized particles and fibers.
p5557
aVFiber internalization occurred within 6 hr of exposure, and nontoxic fibers and particles (wollastonite, TiO2) and carcinogenic fibers (crocidolite, Libby amphibole) all appeared to localize within intracellular vacuoles (Figure 1A, arrowheads).
p5558
aVEvaluation of common SNPs of XRCC1.
p5559
aVNumerous XRCC1 SNPs have been identified, and polymorphisms affecting binding of XRCC1 to DNA repair proteins may result in suboptimal repair.
p5560
aVThe three most extensively studied coding XRCC1 SNPs are Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln.
p5561
aVIn particular, Arg399Gln is associated with elevated risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos- exposed workers (Dianzani et al.
p5562
aV2006; Neri et al.
p5563
aV2008).
p5564
aVCodon 399 is located in the BRCT I domain of XRCC1 required for PARP binding and SSB repair.
p5565
aVArg399Gln is predicted to generate conformational changes within this domain (Monaco et al.
p5566
aV2007), which may impair the ability of XRCC1 to interact with and stabilize PARP at SSBs, thereby reducing repair efficiency.
p5567
aVUsing PCR/RFLP analysis, we found that H460 cells do not contain the Arg194Trp polymorphism, indicated by the lack of a PvuII restriction site at codon 194 (Figure 1B,C).
p5568
aVH460 cells also do not contain the Arg399Gln polymorphism because enzymatic digest with HpaII generates restriction fragments consistent with the wild-type sequence at codon 399.
p5569
aVH460 cells do contain the Arg280His polymorphism, as enzymatic digest with RsaI generates fragments consistent with the polymorphic sequence (Figure 1B,C).
p5570
aVThe presence of this polymorphism, located within the XRCC1 nuclear localization signal, does not appear to affect XRCC1 nuclear localization because XRCC1 is correctly localized to the nucleus (Figure 2A).
p5571
aVXRCC1 deficiency sensitizes to oxidant-induced damage and toxicity.
p5572
aVShort-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting XRCC1 in H460 cells (shXRCC1) induced efficient knockdown of XRCC1 relative to uninfected cells or control shLuc cells (Figure 2B).
p5573
aVCompared with control, XRCC1-knockdown cells exhibited uniform XRCC1 loss (Figure 2A), although XRCC1 was partially reexpressed within 2 weeks postinfection (Figure 2C), despite being cultured in the presence of the selecting antibiotic puromycin.
p5574
aVBased on this finding and on previous studies showing reversal of the phenotypic effects of XRCC1 deletion by low-level XRCC1 expression (Caldecott and Thompson 1994; Tebbs et al.
p5575
aV2003), we began all experiments within 1 week of infection.
p5576
aVTo functionally validate XRCC1 knockdown, we evaluated clonogenic survival of shLuc and shXRCC1 cells exposed to subcytoxic doses of two oxidants, H2O2 and bleomycin.
p5577
aVCompared with controls, XRCC1 knockdown decreased clonogenic survival after exposure to H2O2 or bleomycin (Figure 2D).
p5578
aVIn contrast, XRCC1 deficiency had no effect on clonogenic survival in cells exposed to paclitaxel, a microtubule depolymerization inhibitor whose genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are oxidant independent.
p5579
aVTo test whether XRCC1 knockdown sensitized H460 cells to chromosomal damage, we used CREST immunostaining, which recognizes centromere proteins within the kinetochore of each chromosome.
p5580
aVThe micronucleus/ CREST assay allows determination of the total micronucleus frequency, the frequency of centromere-negative (clastogenic) micronuclei arising from DNA breaks, and the frequency of centromere-positive (aneugenic) micronuclei arising from chromosome loss during mitosis.
p5581
aVRelative to shLuc controls, XRCC1 knockdown increased the frequency of spontaneous micronuclei from 1.4% to 3.8% (p &lt; 0.001) and spontaneous clastogenic micronuclei from 1.2% to 3.4% [p &lt; 0.001; see Supplemental Material, Figure 1A (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002312)],
p5582
aVwhich is consistent with a previous report of increased spontaneous micronuclei formation in Xrcc1-null cells (Qu et al.
p5583
aV2005).
p5584
aVTreatment of both control (shLuc) and XRCC1-deficient (shXRCC1) cells with H2O2 induced a dose-dependent increase in micronuclei, nearly all of which were clastogenic (Figure 2E).
p5585
aVHowever, the percentage of cells with H2O2-induced micronuclei, both total and clastogenic, was increased in XRCC1 knockdown cells compared with controls.
p5586
aVLikewise, bleomycin induced a dose- dependent increase in micronucleus formation in control and XRCC1 knockdown cells, producing almost exclusively clastogenic micronuclei (Figure 2E), with higher percentages of cells with micronuclei (total and clastogenic) in shXRCC1 cells at bleomycin doses between 0.2 µg/mL and 0.5 µg/mL.
p5587
aVHowever, XRCC1 deficiency did not enhance formation of paclitaxel-induced micronuclei, most of which were centromere positive (aneugenic) (Figure 2E).
p5588
aVTaken together, these results confirm that XRCC1 deficiency specifically sensitizes H460 cells to oxidant-induced damage.
p5589
aVXRCC1 deficiency enhances genotoxicity induced by asbestos fibers.
p5590
aVBecause XRCC1 deficiency sensitized to clastogenicity induced by known oxidants (H2O2 and bleomycin),
p5591
aVwe next asked whether it would enhance clastogenic damage induced by asbestos fibers.
p5592
aVTo establish a subcytotoxic dose range of fibers, we evaluated cell proliferation during a 72-hr exposure to wollastonite, TiO2, crocidolite, or Libby amphibole.
p5593
aVWe chose a dose of 5 µg/cm2 because micronucleus induction in parental H460 cells plateaued at doses of crocidolite or Libby amphibole &gt; 5 µg/cm2 [see Supplemental Material, Figure 1B (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002312)] and also because of activation of the p53 pathway after exposure to amphibole fibers at 5 µg/cm2 (see Supplemental Material, Figure 2).
p5594
aVWe observed a pronounced reduction in cell proliferation in XRCC1-knockdown versus control cells (Figure 3A),
p5595
aVconsistent with a report of slower growth rates in Xrcc1-null mouse embryos (Tebbs et al.
p5596
aV1999).
p5597
aVHowever, proliferation was not affected by exposure to nontoxic fibers, TiO2 particles, or asbestos fibers in control or XRCC1-knockdown cells (Figure 3A).
p5598
aVBecause micronucleus formation requires passage through mitosis, we scored micronuclei in control and XRCC1-knockdown cells after 48-hr and 72-hr exposures, respectively, at which times both cell lines had completed one population doubling.
p5599
aVThe percentage of H460 cells with fiber-induced micronuclei was similar at both time points [see Supplemental Material, Figure 1B (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002312)],
p5600
aVindicating that we were not underestimating differences in micronuclei by normalizing to one population doubling.
p5601
aVAs expected, wollastonite and TiO2 did not induce micronuclei in control or XRCC1-knockdown cells (Figure 3B).
p5602
aVIn contrast, crocidolite asbestos and Libby amphibole induced dose-dependent increases in micronucleus formation in both control and XRCC1-knockdown cells.
p5603
aVHowever, the proportion of cells with crocidolite- induced micronuclei (total and clastogenic; Figure 3B,C) and the proportion of crocidolite- induced micronuclei that were clastogenic (mean ± SE, 86.0 ± 1.2% vs. 71.6 ± 3.4% at 5 µg/cm2; p &lt; 0.05) were increased in XRCC1-deficient cells compared with control cells.
p5604
aVInduction of total and clastogenic micronuclei by Libby amphibole also was enhanced in XRCC1-deficient cells compared with controls (Figure 3B,C), along with the proportion of clastogenic micronuclei (mean ± SE, 65.1 ± 2.2% vs. 57.2 ± 2.2% at 5 µg/cm2; p &lt; 0.05).
p5605
aVHowever, the proportion of clastogenic micronuclei induced by Libby amphibole was lower than that observed after exposure to crocidolite (p &lt; 0.05 for shLuc and shXRCC1 cells).
p5606
aVTaken together, these results indicate that XRCC1 deficiency sensitizes cells to the genotoxic and clastogenic effects of crocidolite and Libby amphibole.
p5607
aVAlthough XRCC1 knockdown did not inhibit proliferation of H460 cells at a fiber dose of 5 µg/cm2, it was possible that higher doses would inhibit
p5608
aVgrowth.
p5609
aVAND
p5610
aVTo investigate this possibility, we exposed control and XRCC1-knockdown cells to 5\u201320 µg/cm2 fibers for 72 hr.
p5611
aVAlthough crocidolite asbestos and, to a lesser extent, Libby amphibole decreased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, this was not enhanced by XRCC1 deficiency [see Supplemental Material, Figure 3A (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002312)].
p5612
aVExtending the duration of fiber exposure to 96 hr further increased the growth inhibition by crocidolite asbestos and Libby amphibole; however, this was not further enhanced by XRCC1 deficiency (see Supplemental Material, Figure 3B).
p5613
aVThese results indicate that, although XRCC1 sensitizes to genotoxicity induced by carcinogenic fibers, it does not potentiate their growth inhibitory effects.
p5614
aVXRCC1 deficiency enhances formation of nuclear buds.
p5615
aVAlthough micronuclei are widely used indicators of genomic damage, nuclear buds are another, less commonly studied, marker of genotoxicity.
p5616
aVIn contrast to micronuclei, which are detached from the main nucleus, nuclear buds remain attached to the nucleus through a thin nucleoplasmic stalk (Fenech 2007) [see Supplemental Material, Figure 4A (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002312)].
p5617
aVXRCC1 deficiency increased the frequency of spontaneous nuclear buds from 4.9% to 9.1% (p &lt; 0.05 compared with shLuc control cells); therefore, we expressed the data after background subtraction.
p5618
aVBecause it was possible that the kinetics of nuclear bud formation were different from that of micronuclei and potentially did not depend on cell division, we compared bud formation after 24, 48, and 72 hr of exposure to fibers at doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 10 µg/cm2 (Figure 4A).
p5619
aVWollastonite and TiO2 did not induce nuclear bud formation (see Supplemental Material, Figure 4B).
p5620
aVCrocidolite asbestos induced bud formation that reached a maximum at 2.5\u20135 µg/cm2 (Figure 4A) and was enhanced in XRCC1-deficient cells compared with controls at all doses.
p5621
aVHowever, Libby amphibole did not induce significant bud formation in control or XRCC1-deficient cells (Figure 4A).
p5622
aVH2O2, a potent inducer of SSBs, also did not induce bud formation in control or XRCC1-deficient cells.
p5623
aVIn contrast, exposure to bleomycin, a radiomimetic chemotherapeutic agent that induces substantial double-strand breaks (DSBs) in addition to SSBs, caused a dose-dependent increase in nuclear buds in control cells that was significantly enhanced by XRCC1 knockdown (Figure 4B).
p5624
aVTaken together, our results suggest that XRCC1 protects H460 cells from genotoxicity induced by crocidolite asbestos or Libby amphibole.
p5625
aVIn this study we developed a genetic model of XRCC1 deficiency in human lung epithelial cells that is highly relevant to asbestos carcinogenesis and offers several advantages over other experimental models,
p5626
aVincluding a low level of spontaneous micronuclei and sensitivity to genotoxicants at low doses (Reynolds et al.
p5627
aV2009; Reynolds and Zhitkovich 2007).
p5628
aVGenetic models of DNA repair deficiency allow us to directly evaluate the contribution of particular DNA lesions to fiber-induced genotoxicity in the absence of downstream effects on multiple cellular stress response pathways, as can happen with antioxidant-based approaches.
p5629
aVImpact of XRCC1 on asbestos genotoxicity.
p5630
aVCrocidolite and Libby amphibole asbestos induced dose-dependent increases in micronuclei in control cells, which were enhanced by XRCC1 deficiency.
p5631
aVInterestingly, the relative proportions of clastogenic micronuclei varied considerably because crocidolite induced primarily clastogenic micronuclei, whereas Libby amphibole induced both aneugenic and clastogenic damage.
p5632
aVWe also observed nuclear buds in H460 cells treated with bleomycin or with crocidolite, but not with Libby amphibole or nongenotoxic fibers or particulates.
p5633
aVNuclear buds containing amplified DNA have been described in tumor cells (Shimizu et al.
p5634
aV1998) and in folate-deprived lymphocytes (Lindberg et al.
p5635
aV2007),
p5636
aVbut this is the first report of nuclear bud formation in response to asbestos fibers.
p5637
aVThe mechanism of nuclear bud formation is unclear, although nuclear buds formed during interphase may represent precursors to micronuclei (Serrano-Garcia and Montero-Montoya 2001); however, our observations that H2O2 and Libby amphibole induce micronuclei but not nuclear buds are inconsistent with this hypothesis.
p5638
aVNuclear buds may also form as part of a mechanism to remove excess nuclear DNA, or from broken anaphase bridges (Gisselsson et al.
p5639
aV2001).
p5640
aVOur findings in H2O2- and bleomycin-treated cells suggest that the formation of nuclear buds is associated with clustered DNA damage.
p5641
aVAlthough H2O2 induces primarily SSBs that are randomly distributed within DNA, bleomycin produces SSBs, DSBs, and clustered DNA damage (Regulus et al.
p5642
aV2007).
p5643
aVCompared with H2O2, which did not induce significant bud formation, bleomycin induced a dose-dependent increase in nuclear buds, which was enhanced by XRCC1 deficiency, suggesting that nuclear buds could arise because of clustered DNA damage.
p5644
aVCrocidolite, like bleomycin, induced nuclear bud formation that was enhanced by XRCC1 deficiency, suggesting that crocidolite, but not Libby amphibole, has the potential to induce clustered DNA damage.
p5645
aVDifferential genotoxicity of crocidolite asbestos and Libby amphibole.
p5646
aVAlthough both crocidolite and Libby are amphiboles, their distinct physicochemical properties may influence the types of damage they produce.
p5647
aVClastogenic micronuclei arise from chromosome breaks, and the ability of asbestos to generate DNA breaks is strongly linked to the presence of fiber-associated iron and ROS generation (Shukla et al.
p5648
aV2003).
p5649
aVCrocidolite asbestos contains up to 27% iron by weight (Timbrell 1970), whereas Libby amphibole contains approximately 5% iron by weight (Meeker et al.
p5650
aV2003).
p5651
aVTherefore, the different proportions of clastogenic micronuclei generated by crocidolite asbestos and Libby amphibole may reflect their different iron contents.
p5652
aVIn addition to differences in bulk iron content, crocidolite and Libby amphibole differ greatly in amounts of bioavailable redox-active iron, which is responsible for ROS generation (Hardy and Aust 1995).
p5653
aVUsing an assay to assess iron bioavailability, we observed that iron mobilization was 20 times higher per milligram of crocidolite versus Libby amphibole (Kulaots I, Vaslet C, Kane AB, unpublished data).
p5654
aVIron bioavailability and redox activity are also related to surface area, which is 9.1 m2/g for crocidolite compared with 5.3 m2/g for Libby amphibole.
p5655
aVFinally, these amphiboles differ in homogeneity, geometry, and fiber size distribution.
p5656
aVUICC crocidolite asbestos is a homogeneous sample ranging from 30 to 500 nm in diameter and up to 20 µm in length.
p5657
aVIn contrast, Libby amphibole is a mixture of six amphiboles, mostly winchite (84%), richterite (11%), and tremolite (6%), including prismatic crystals, acicular fragments, and bundles of fibrils approximately 100 nm to 1 µm in diameter with lengths up to 20 µm (Meeker et al.
p5658
aV2003).
p5659
aVThe heterogeneity of Libby amphibole, in addition to its lower bioavailable iron, may be associated with its lower clastogenicity compared with crocidolite in the present study.
p5660
aVAlthough the mechanistic basis for these differences remains to be determined, these results are the first to indicate that Libby amphibole has genotoxic potential in a cell type relevant to malignant transformation and that, in this model system, Libby amphibole induces both clastogenic and aneugenic damage, whereas crocidolite induces primarily clastogenic damage.
p5661
aVIn contrast to genotoxicity, XRCC1 deficiency did not affect growth inhibition by crocidolite or Libby amphibole.
p5662
aVH460 cells are not resistant to asbestos-induced growth inhibition because higher doses and longer exposures reduced cell proliferation [see Supplemental Material, Figure 2 (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002312)].

aVXRCC1 appeared to protect cells from asbestos-induced genotoxicity in this model, but the pathways responsible for the growth-inhibitory effects of fibers are XRCC1 independent and may involve multiple forms of damage or generalized oxidative stress (Kamp et al.
p5664
aV2002).
p5665
aVOur observation that XRCC1 deficiency sensitizes cells to the genotoxic effects of asbestos fibers provides the first mechanistic evidence to support the association between XRCC1 polymorphisms and asbestos-related diseases.
p5666
aVCells exposed to asbestos fibers in the context of reduced XRCC1-mediated DNA repair are expected to accumulate higher levels of chromosomal DNA damage.
p5667
aVContinued proliferation in the presence of biopersistent fibers could result in additional genomic alterations that promote malignant transformation.
p5668
aVXRCC1 deficiency or reduced XRCC1 function may exacerbate genomic instability, increasing the risk of asbestos- associated malignancy.

aVBackground: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous environmental chemical with reported endocrine-disrupting properties.
p5670
aVObjective: Our goal in this study was to determine whether prenatal exposure to BPA predisposes the adult rat mammary gland to carcinogenesis.
p5671
aVMethods: Pregnant rats were treated orally with 0, 25, or 250 µg BPA/kg body weight (BW) from gestation day (GD) 10 to GD21.
p5672
aVFor tumorigenesis experiments, prenatally exposed female offspring received a single gavage of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA; 30 mg/kg BW) on postnatal day (PND) 50, or PND100.
p5673
aVResults: Prenatal exposure of the dam to 250 µg BPA/kg BW combined with a single exposure of female offspring to DMBA on PND100, but not on PND50, significantly increased tumor incidence while decreasing tumor latency compared with the control group.
p5674
aVPrenatal exposure of the dam to 250 µg BPA/kg BW, in the absence of DMBA to the female offspring, increased cell proliferation and elicited differential effects at the protein level at PND100 compared with PND50.
p5675
aVDifferentially regulated proteins in the mammary gland included estrogen receptor-\u03b1, progesterone receptor-A, Bcl-2, steroid receptor coactivators, epidermal growth factor receptor, phospho-insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and phospho-Raf.
p5676
aVConclusions: Our study demonstrates that oral prenatal exposure to BPA increases mammary cancer susceptibility in offspring and shifts the window of susceptibility for DMBA-induced tumorigenesis in the rat mammary gland from PND50 to PND100.
p5677
aVThese changes are accompanied by differential effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the expression of key proteins involved in cell proliferation.

aVThe authors treated pregnant rats orally with BPA on gestation days 10\u201321.
p5682
aVFor tumorigenesis studies, prenatally exposed female offspring received a single gavage of dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) on postnatal day (PND) 50 or PND100.
p5683
aVThe authors report that prenatal exposure of the dam to BPA, combined with a single exposure of female offspring to DMBA on PND100\u2014but not on PND50\u2014significantly increased tumor incidence while decreasing tumor latency.

aVPrenatal exposure of the dam to BPA in the absence of DMBA increased cell proliferation and elicited differential effects at the protein level at PND100 compared with PND50.
p5685
aVThe authors conclude that oral prenatal exposure to BPA increases mammary cancer susceptibility in offspring and shifts the window of susceptibility for DMBA-induced tumorigenesis in the rat mammary gland from PND50 to PND100.

aVThese changes are accompanied by differential effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the expression of key proteins involved in cell proliferation.

aVFetuses, newborns, infants, and adolescents are populations uniquely susceptible to biochemical insult from environmental chemicals.
p5688
aVAlthough some of these toxicities may be evident immediately, some exposures that take place during early critical periods of development can result in subtle alterations that are delayed in expression.
p5689
aVHence, at the time of clinical manifestation in adulthood, the original chemical effector may no longer be measurable.
p5690
aVOne such environmental chemical is bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical originally developed for use as a synthetic estrogen and now one of the highest-volume chemicals produced in the world (Burridge 2003; Welshons et al.
p5691
aV2006).
p5692
aVBPA is used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and resins, which are commonly used in the packaging of canned foods and in beverage bottles.
p5693
aVBPA may be ingested by humans, as it reportedly leaches from the lining of food and soda cans, (Biles et al.
p5694
aV1997; Brotons et al.
p5695
aV1994), polycarbonate bottles (Kang et al.
p5696
aV2006), and dental sealants (Olea et al.
p5697
aV1996).
p5698
aVAs a consequence of this widespread opportunity for exposure, an estimated 95% of Americans tested, including young girls, show detectable concentrations of BPA in their urine (Calafat et al.
p5699
aV2005; Wolff et al.
p5700
aV2007).
p5701
aVConcern regarding the potential role of BPA in breast cancer is supported by animal studies showing the developing mammary gland as one of the tissues targeted by prenatal BPA exposure (Durando et al.
p5702
aV2007).
p5703
aVMarkey et al.
p5704
aV(2001) showed that mice exposed in utero to 250 µg BPA/kg body weight (BW) via osmotic pumps had a significantly greater number of ductal and alveolar structures relative to the control group on postnatal day (PND) 180.
p5705
aVSimilarly, Murray et al.
p5706
aV(2007) reported the development of ductal hyperplasia in CD-1 mice on PND50 and PND95 after prenatal exposure to 2.5, 25, 50, and 1,000 µg BPA/kg BW/day.
p5707
aVIn another study, Moral et al.
p5708
aV(2008) showed that adult offspring exposed prenatally via dams treated orally with 250 µg BPA/kg BW/day had modifications of the mammary gland architecture, mainly in the number of undifferentiated epithelial structures of the tissue.
p5709
aVA previous study from our laboratory (Jenkins et al.
p5710
aV2009) showed that prepubertal exposure to BPA increased 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley CD rats on PND50.
p5711
aVTherefore, our next goal was to determine if in utero exposure to BPA would elicit a similar response in the mammary gland after carcinogenic insult.
p5712
aVIn the initial phase of the study, we investigated the effects of prenatal BPA exposure [25 or 250 µg/kg BW/day on gestation day (GD) 10\u2013GD21] on tumorigenesis and protein expression at PND50 in rats.
p5713
aVFor the second phase of the study, we investigated the effects of prenatal BPA exposure (250 µg/kg BW/day) on tumorigenesis and protein expression at PND100.
p5714
aVDifferential protein expression patterns induced by prenatal exposure to BPA in the mammary gland on PND50 and PND100 suggest a possible mechanism of action for the increased susceptibility of the mammary gland to chemically induced carcinogenesis on PND100.

aVChemicals.
p5716
aVWe obtained antibodies to phospho-c-proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase (phospho-c-Raf), phospho-insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (phospho-IGF-1R), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (phospho-ErbB2), phospho-serine/threonine-protein kinase Akt (phospho-Akt), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA).
p5717
aVSteroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), SRC-2/ transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (SRC-2/TIF2), and SRC-3/amplified in breast cancer-1 protein antibodies were purchased from Becton, Dickinson and Company (Franklin Lakes, NJ).
p5718
aVEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1), progesterone receptor (PR), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) antibodies were purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (phospho-ERK 1/2) antibodies were from Promega (Madison, WI).
p5719
aVAll other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).

aVAnimals.
p5721
aVAnimal studies were conducted in accordance with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Guidelines for Animal Use and Care.
p5722
aVAnimals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering.
p5723
aVAdult male and female Sprague-Dawley CD rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC) were housed in a temperature-\u200bcontrolled environment (22 ± 2°C) with a 12-hr dark-light cycle (lights on between 0800 and 2000 hours).
p5724
aVThe initial experiments were designed to determine the potential of prenatal exposure to BPA to alter a) the endocrine system during postnatal development; b) ER-\u03b1, SRC, and growth factor signaling protein levels in the mammary gland; and c) susceptibility to chemically induced mammary cancer at PND50 in the resulting offspring.
p5725
aVFor this, pregnant rats (a minimum of 30/group) were gavaged with BPA at 25 µg/kg BW/day (low dose) or 250 µg/kg BW/day (high dose), or an equivalent volume of sesame oil (control group) on GD10\u2013GD21.
p5726
aVTwo additional groups of animals were also exposed prenatally to high-dose BPA (250 µg/kg BW) and control treatments to investigate a potential shift in the period of susceptibility for chemically induced mammary cancer at PND100 in the resulting offspring.
p5727
aVAnimals were bred, and female rats were observed for the presence of sperm.
p5728
aVOnce sperm positive (noted as GD0), pregnant females were housed individually in polypropylene cages (BPA-free) with glass water bottles, fed the phytoestrogen-free AIN-93G (growth) diet (Dyets Inc, Bethlehem, PA), and randomly assigned to a treatment group.
p5729
aVOn the day of birth (designated as PND0), offspring were sexed, and litters were culled to 10 females per lactating dam.
p5730
aVThe female offspring were weaned on PND21 and continued on AIN-93G diet until PND70, when they were switched to AIN-93M (mature) diet.
p5731
aVOn PND50 ± 1 and PND100 ± 2, two sets (n = 8/treatment group) of identically treated rats were killed in the estrous phase.
p5732
aVThe fourth abdominal mammary glands were rapidly dissected from live ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized animals prior to euthanasia.
p5733
aVOne set of mammary glands was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380°C until assayed via immunoblotting.
p5734
aVThe contralateral gland was fixed in formalin for paraffin embedding.
p5735
aVFor each treatment group on both PND50 and PND100, mammary gland samples from individual rats randomly selected from each litter of each treatment group (8\u201310 rats/treatment group) were used for either immunoblotting or paraffin embedding.
p5736
aVBecause chemical treatment of a dam during prenatal exposure results in a single exposure group per treatment, one offspring in each litter was treated as a single observation.
p5737
aVTumorigenesis experiments.
p5738
aVFor tumorigenesis experiments, one female offspring from each litter was given a single gavage of 30 mg DMBA/kg BW on PND50 or PND100.
p5739
aVThis DMBA dose routinely results in a low number of mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats and allows chemicals that predispose for mammary cancer to increase the number of mammary adenocarcinomas (Brown et al.
p5740
aV1998; Jenkins et al.
p5741
aV2009).
p5742
aVOn PND50, we treated 31 control, 29 low-dose BPA, and 33 high-dose BPA offspring (each from a separate litter) with DBMA; on PND100, 30 control and 28 high-dose BPA offspring were treated with DBMA.
p5743
aVAnimals were palpated twice weekly to monitor tumor development; data were recorded on palpable tumor latency, location, and multiplicity.

p5756
aVImmunoblotting was performed on six to eight biological samples per treatment group, each sample derived from only one rat randomly selected from separate litters per treatment group, as previously described by Rowell et al.

p5758
aVBriefly, whole mammary glands were ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (Pierce Biotechnolgy, Rockford, IL).

p5771
aVPositively stained cells were visualized by incubating the slides with 3,3´-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
p5772
aVSlides were dehydrated with graded alcohols, cleared with xylene, and mounted with a glass coverslip.
p5773
aVWe used six biologically distinct samples derived from individual litters and counted a minimum of three ductal structures per slide.

p5777
aVCells that stained positive with DAB and exhibited morphological characteristics of apoptosis were counted as positive.

p5780
aVThe time to first tumor (latency) and time to sacrifice (tumor burden \u2265 10% of BW) were analyzed using the LIFETEST and LIFEREG procedures in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
p5781
aVSurvival functions were first estimated for each group using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across the groups using the Wilcoxon log-rank test and parametrically using survival regression analysis (Collette 2003).
p5782
aVAnimals that had not developed a tumor by the end of the study or were sacrificed before the end of the study were censored, and the end of study or sacrifice times were treated as censoring times.

aVTumor multiplicity was analyzed by the Cochran-Armitage trend test.
p5784
aVFor cell proliferation and apoptosis, we used the values for stained versus unstained cells to construct a contingency table.

aVWestern blots were tested for equality of variance using a two-sample F-test, and the appropriate (assuming equal or unequal variance) two-sample t-test was used.
p5786
aVp-Values \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
p5787
aVTo evaluate dose response, we treated pregnant rats with 0, 25, or 250 µg BPA/kg BW on GD10\u2013GD21.
p5788
aVThese BPA exposures did not significantly alter body weights of 2-, 7-, 14-, 21-, 35-, 50-, and 100-day-old female offspring (data not shown).
p5789
aVSimilarly, prenatal exposure to BPA did not significantly alter the time to vaginal opening [32.5 ± 0.3, 34.4 ± 0.3, and 32.6 ± 0.3 days (mean ± SE) for the zero-, low-, and high-dose BPA groups, respectively].
p5790
aVSerum concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol from 50-day-old female offspring were not significantly different from controls (11.0 ± 1.2, 12.2 ± 2.3, and 14.5 ± 2.5 pg/mL for the zero-, low-, and high-BPA doses, respectively).
p5791
aVLikewise, serum progesterone concentrations were not significantly different from controls (11.8 ± 2.1, 11.5 ± 1.2, and 9.4 ± 1.3 ng/mL for the zero-, low-, and high-BPA doses, respectively).
p5792
aVEvaluation of estrous cyclicity of adult female offspring did not show significant changes from either BPA dose (data not shown).

aVPND50 DMBA treatment and induced mammary carcinogenesis.
p5794
aVUsing the well- established chemically induced mammary cancer model, we treated female rats with DMBA on day 50, because this age has been shown to be optimum to induce mammary cancer in Sprague-Dawley rats (Russo et al.
p5795
aV1979; Welsch 1985).
p5796
aVPalpating for mammary tumors, we found no significant difference for average time to first tumor for rats exposed prenatally to sesame oil only (controls), or to 25 µg or 250 µg BPA/kg BW (mean ± SE, 109 ± 11 days, 116 ± 14, 106 ± 14, respectively).
p5797
aVAt time of necropsy, we found no significant difference in tumor multiplicity (2.94 ± 0.48, 2.38 ± 0.42, and 2.88 ± 0.40 tumors/rat exposed to 0, 25, and 250 µg BPA/kg BW, respectively) after DMBA treatment at day 50.
p5798
aVDifferential protein expression.
p5799
aVWe previously reported that the prenatal high BPA dose (250 µg/kg BW) resulted in the maximum number of modulated genes (Moral et al.
p5800
aV2008) and proteins (Betancourt et al.
p5801
aV2010) at day 100 compared with day 50; therefore, we focused our mechanism of action studies on mammary glands of rats exposed prenatally to and 250 µg BPA/kg BW at those two ages.
p5802
aVER-\u03b1 was significantly down-regulated at PND50 (p = 0.002), but up-regulated at PND100 (p = 0.042) after prenatal BPA exposure (Figure 1).
p5803
aVThe expression of two downstream targets of ER (PR and Bcl-2) on both PND50 and PND100 were analyzed as indicators of ER action.
p5804
aVOn PND50, both PR-A and Bcl-2 were significantly decreased (p = 0.003 and p = 0.023, respectively) relative to controls.
p5805
aVOn PND100, Bcl-2 was significantly increased (p = 0.01), and PR-A showed a nonsignificant increase (p = 0.09) (Figure 1).
p5806
aVBecause one important factor influencing transcriptional activity of ER-\u03b1 is the quantity of coregulators present in a given tissue, we determined protein levels of the steroid receptor coactivators SRC-1, -2, and -3 (Figure 2).
p5807
aVOn PND50, only SRC-3 was significantly increased (p = 0.05).
p5808
aVHowever, on PND100, all members of the SRC family up-regulated (SRC-1, p = 0.003; SRC-2, p = 0.002; and SRC-3, p = 0.002).
p5809
aVIn addition, because prenatal BPA exposure has been shown to increase cell proliferation in the mammary gland of the postnatal rat (Durando et al.
p5810
aV2007), we measured key growth factor receptors and downstream signaling molecules (Figure 3).
p5811
aVAt PND100, BPA significantly increased expression of EGFR (p = 0.0132), phospho-IGF-1R (p = 0.007), phospho-c-Raf (p = 0.029), phospho-ERKs 1/2 (p = 0.030), phospho-ErbB2 (p = 0.039), and phospho-Akt (p = 0.017).
p5812
aVHowever, on PND50, prenatal BPA exposure significantly up-regulated only phospho-ErbB2 (p = 0.018), phospho-ERK 1/2 (p = 0.005), and phospho-Akt (p = 0.016).
p5813
aVCell proliferation and apoptosis.
p5814
aVBecause of the significant changes in protein expression on PND100 in offspring with prenatal BPA exposure, we also investigated cell proliferation and apoptosis in mammary glands at PND100.
p5815
aVWe found increased Ki-67 expression in the epithelial cells, but not the stroma, of mammary tubular ducts of 100-day-old rats prenatally exposed to BPA 250 (p &lt; 0.05) (Figure 4) compared with controls.
p5816
aVHowever, prenatal BPA exposure did not alter apoptosis in the mammary glands of these rats (p = 0.85) (data not shown).
p5817
aVPND100 DMBA treatment and induced mammary carcinogenesis.
p5818
aVBecause prenatal BPA exposure affected more signaling pathways in the mammary glands of PND100 rats than of PND50 rats, our next step was to investigate whether those effects could translate to differences in the susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis on PND100 as opposed to PND50.
p5819
aVTo test this hypothesis, we treated female offspring exposed in utero to either sesame oil (control group) or BPA 250 µg/kg BW with DMBA by a single gavage on PND100.
p5820
aVTumor incidence was significantly increased in the BPA group (83.3%) versus the control group (53.6%) (p = 0.022), and there was a nonsignificant increase in tumor multiplicity [2.53 ± 0.55 vs. 1.96 ± 0.53 (mean ± SE) in BPA-exposed and control animals, respectively; p = 0.07] (Figure 5).
p5821
aVFemale offspring exposed in utero to BPA 250 µg/kg BW also showed significantly decreased tumor latency (p = 0.012) compared with the control group (Figure 5C) after DBMA exposure on PND100.
p5822
aVIn addition, we classified a significantly greater proportion of DMBA-induced mammary tumors as grade II (according to the Bloom-Richardson system) in BPA-exposed animals (9 of 20 tumors; 45%) versus control animals (3 of 13 tumors; 23%) (p = 0.0484).
p5823
aVA single tumor from each animal was randomly selected for histopathological analysis.
p5824
aVThe primary aim of this study was to determine if prenatal BPA exposure would predispose the adult rat mammary gland to carcinogenesis and if the protein signature could provide an insight into the possible targets of BPA in the mammary gland.
p5825
aVWe choose the DMBA-induced mammary cancer model in Sprague-Dawley rats because there is similarity in ontogeny of mammary gland development and morphology in rats and humans (Russo et al.
p5826
aV1990).
p5827
aVDMBA-induced mammary cancer displays pathology similar to human breast cancer, including a common site of origin and a similar pattern of tumor development (McCormick and Moon 1965; Murad and von Haam 1972; Russo et al.
p5828
aV1977), and mammary cancers can be reproducibly induced with a high frequency in this model.
p5829
aVIn studies of cancer causation or chemoprevention, the standard protocol for administering DMBA is at day 50, because this is within the period (days 40\u201360) of high mitotic index in the terminal ductal structures of rats (Russo et al.
p5830
aV1983; Welsch 1985).
p5831
aVUsing this protocol, we found no significant difference in tumor multiplicity or tumor latency in rats exposed prenatally to either of the BPA doses (25 and 250 µg/kg BW) after DMBA exposure on PND50.
p5832
aVBased on previous evidence suggesting differences in the mechanism of action of BPA at different ages (Betancourt et al.
p5833
aV2010; Moral et al.
p5834
aV2008), we suspected that the window of susceptibility for DBMA-induced mammary cancer might be shifted from day 50 to day 100 after prenatal BPA exposure.
p5835
aVConsequently, we found that DMBA treatment at PND100 resulted in a significantly higher incidence of mammary tumors in rats exposed prenatally to BPA.
p5836
aVIn addition, relative to control animals, prenatal BPA exposure decreased the latency period (average time to first tumor after DBMA treatment) by 78 days.
p5837
aVFurthermore, mammary tumors in the high-dose BPA group (250 µg/kg BW) were more likely than those in control rats to be classified as grade II according to the Bloom-Richardson scoring index, which is based on adenocarcinoma tubular pattern, nuclear grade, and mitotic index (Meyer et al.
p5838
aV2005).
p5839
aVThe doses chosen for this study (25 and 250 µg BPA/kg BW to pregnant dams) were based on reported human exposures, experimental studies in rats, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum acceptable dose.
p5840
aVSerum BPA concentrations in pregnant human females have been reported to be 0.46\u201319 µg/L (Kuroda et al.
p5841
aV2003; Schonfelder et al.
p5842
aV2002; Welshons et al.
p5843
aV2006).
p5844
aVExposure assessments have ranged from 0.2 µg/L (nanograms per gram of tissue) in human fetal cord serum up to 105 µg/L in human placenta (Kuroda et al.
p5845
aV2003).
p5846
aVWithin the United States, an exposure of up to 50 µg/kg/day (50 ppb) is considered safe by the U.S. EPA, satisfying a 1,000-fold margin of safety (U.S. EPA 1988).
p5847
aVConsidering metabolism and disposition by the pregnant female rat and dilution to each individual fetus, it is calculated that each offspring would be exposed to 100\u20131,000 times less BPA than the treated mother.
p5848
aVConsequently, the offspring of dams exposed to the high (250 µg/kg BW) and low (25 µg/kg BW) BPA doses would have been exposed to approximately 0.25\u20132.5 and 0.025\u20130.25 µg BPA/kg BW/day, respectively (Kurebayashi et al.
p5849
aV2005; Snyder et al.
p5850
aV2000), which is less than the daily tolerable dose of 50 µg/kg BW/day established by the U.S. EPA.
p5851
aVIn the present study we did not observe any toxic effects on body weight, vaginal opening, estrous cyclicity, and serum estrogen and progesterone concentrations in offspring exposed to either BPA dose.
p5852
aVSo why were rats that were prenatally exposed to BPA more susceptible to DMBA carcinogenesis at PND100 than at PND50?
p5853
aVPreviously, we reported that prenatal treatment with 250 µg BPA/kg BW resulted in a significantly increased number of terminal ducts at PND100 but not at PND50 (Moral et al.
p5854
aV2008).
p5855
aVTerminal end buds and terminal ducts are considered the most susceptible terminal ductal structures of the rat mammary gland because of the high mitotic index and undifferentiated state of the cells in these structures (Russo and Russo 1978).
p5856
aVBeyond that, terminal ductule hyperplasia is an early lesion present in rat mammary carcinogenesis (Haslam and Bern 1977; Shina and Dao 1975).
p5857
aVOur finding of increased Ki-67 expression in the mammary ducts of 100-day-old rats after prenatal exposure to BPA suggests that increased susceptibility to DBMA-induced carcinogenesis is a possible consequence of BPA-mediated effects on cell proliferation.
p5858
aVIn addition, Markey et al.
p5859
aV(2001) reported that mice exposed to 250 µg BPA/kg BW/day by means of Alzet osmotic pumps during gestation had a significant increase in all epithelial structures on PND180.
p5860
aVTherefore, greater availability of target structures\u2014in addition to a cellular microenvironment favoring carcinogenesis\u2014could explain the increased tumorigenesis response.
p5861
aVAt the molecular level, our previous gene array studies demonstrated that prenatal BPA exposure significantly down-regulated a number of breast differentiation markers at PND100, including Fabp3, the homolog to mammary-derived growth inhibitor, a tumor suppressor (Hu et al.
p5862
aV1997; Yang et al.
p5863
aV1994), and whey acidic protein, a mammary differentiation marker (Dandekar et al.
p5864
aV1982).
p5865
aVAlthough it is attractive to explain cancer susceptibility at the gene level, this needs to be validated at the protein level.
p5866
aVUsing Western blot analysis, we found differential effects of BPA exposure on ER-\u03b1 and SRC protein expression in the mammary gland.
p5867
aVER-\u03b1 was down-regulated at PND50, but up-regulated at PND100 in high-dose BPA offspring compared with controls.
p5868
aVThe expression of downstream targets of ER (PR-A and Bcl-2) (Henriksen et al.
p5869
aV2009) in mammary glands on PND50 and PND100 followed an expression pattern similar to ER-\u03b1 at each age, suggesting that increased expression of this receptor plays an active role in increased susceptibility to tumorigenic effects of DMBA on PND100.
p5870
aVThis is also consistent with the fact that DMBA-induced mammary cancer in rats is initially estrogen dependent (Bradley et al.
p5871
aV1976),
p5872
aVas we would expect an increase in carcinogenesis with exposure to DBMA at PND100 versus PND50 if there is more ER signaling at that time.
p5873
aVFurthermore, we observed that SRCs 1\u20133 were all up-regulated in BPA-exposed rats compared with controls at PND100, but only SRC-3 was significantly up-regulated at PND50.
p5874
aVThis shift in the expression of ER-\u03b1 and the sex steroid coregulators may explain the shift in the window of susceptibility to DBMA-induced carcinogenesis.
p5875
aVOur finding of increased steroid receptor coregulator expression after BPA treatment is not without precedent, as we have previously reported that prepubertal exposure to BPA (PND2\u2013PND20) results in up-regulated SRCs 1\u20133 at 50 days of age (Jenkins et al.
p5876
aV2009).
p5877
aVHence, there is commonality in expression of up-regulated SRCs 1\u20133 as well as susceptibility for chemically induced mammary cancer, after prenatal and prepubertal BPA exposure.
p5878
aVOur results suggest a plausible mechanism of action by which prenatal BPA exposure could alter signaling molecules, which in turn could increase cell proliferation and contribute to increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis.
p5879
aVFirst, increased levels of EGFR on PND100 suggest the availability of more receptors to activate Ras (Ras-GTP) and subsequently Raf-1, which through a series of intermediate steps results in phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK 1/2.
p5880
aVThese activated kinases then translocate into the nucleus where they phosphorylate specific transcription factors involved in cell proliferation.
p5881
aVSecond, increased activation of phospho-IGF-1R on PND100 could potentially induce activation of phospho-Akt as well as MAPK signaling pathways that promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis.
p5882
aVAlternatively, EGFR can induce activation of Akt by forming heterodimers with other members of the ErbB family.
p5883
aVAkt activity is elevated in several types of human malignancy, including breast, ovarian, lung, and thyroid cancers (Vivanco and Sawyers 2002).
p5884
aVThird, increased activation of phospho-ErbB2 can lead to increased Akt and MAPK signaling.
p5885
aVConvergence of the EGFR/erbB2 and IGF-1R signaling pathways could contribute to increased cell proliferation on PND100 and increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis after DBMA exposure on PND100 and explain the lack of BPA effects on tumorigenesis after DBMA exposure on PND50, when only phospho-ErbB2, phospho-Akt, and phospho-ERK 1/2 were increased in BPA-exposed animals.
p5886
aVOn the other hand, SRCs have been reported to directly influence steroid receptor action, and they have also been suggested as transcription factors that may indirectly promote steroid-mediated gene transcription by increasing growth factor signaling (O\u2019Malley and Kumar 2009).
p5887
aVIn addition, SRCs have been shown to interact with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/erbB2) (Bouras et al.
p5888
aV2001), and overexpression of HER2 and SRC-3 are both associated with a worse prognosis in cases of human breast cancer (Kirkegaard et al.
p5889
aV2007; McIlroy et al.
p5890
aV2006).
p5891
aVWe found that prenatal BPA exposure increased the level of ER-\u03b1 and all three members of the SRC family on PND100 in rats.
p5892
aVThese effects may translate to increased ER-\u03b1 signaling and also suggest that cross-talk of SRCs and HER2/erbB2 could further promote an increase in cell proliferation on PND100 that is not present in the mammary gland on PND50 when ER-\u03b1 is decreased and only SRC-3 is increased.
p5893
aV0
aV0 research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
p5894
aVAdditional research is also needed to determine the underlying mechanism linking early exposure to BPA to long-lasting effects on the mature animal.
p5895
aVThe prevailing hypothesis is that prenatal (or early postnatal) exposure to a hormonally active chemical can permanently alter gene expression by altering DNA methylation or chromatin assembly (Ho et al.
p5896
aV2006; Hsu et al.
p5897
aV2010).
p5898
aVImprinting or organizational effects during early critical periods of development have been described that cause permanent manifestations later in life, even in the absence of the original effector (Baylin et al.
p5899
aV1998; Lamartiniere 2002; Lamartiniere et al.
p5900
aV1982).
p5901
aVWe believe that imprinting after exposure to BPA and other hormonally active chemicals can determine the biochemical blueprint of mammary tissue responses to future stimuli in adults.
p5902
aVTo explore if exposures to specific heavy metals in the environment is a new risk factor of oral cancer, one of the fastest growing malignancies in Taiwan, in addition to the two established risk factors, cigarette smoking and betel quid chewing.
p5903
aVThis is an observational study utilized the age-standardized incidence rates of oral cancer in the 316 townships and precincts of Taiwan, local prevalence rates of cigarette smoking and betel quid chewing, demographic factors, socio-economic conditions, and concentrations in farm soils of the eight kinds of heavy metal.
p5904
aVSpatial regression and GIS (Geographic Information System) were used.
p5905
aVThe registration contained 22,083 patients, who were diagnosed with oral cancer between 1982 and 2002.
p5906
aVThe concentrations of metal in the soils were retrieved from a nation-wide survey in the 1980s.
p5907
aVThe incidence rate of oral cancer is geographically related to the concentrations of arsenic and nickel in the patients' residential areas,
p5908
aVwith the prevalence of cigarette smoking and betel quid chewing as controlled variables.
p5909
aVBeside the two established risk factors, cigarette smoking and betel quid chewing, arsenic and nickel in farm soils may be new risk factors for oral cancer.
p5910
aVThese two kinds of metal may involve in the development of oral cancer.
p5911
aVFurther studies are required to understand the pathways via which metal in the farm soils exerts its effects on human health.
p5912
aVHeavy metals are trace elements in the environment.
p5913
aVTheir content and distribution in the air, water or soils are decided by both the nature and human activities.
p5914
aVThere is already an abundant literature addressing the effects on human health by exposures to these heavy metals 1.
p5915
aVSome of them are known to play a role in the development of human cancers 2.
p5916
aVA notorious example is the increased incidence of lung, skin and bladder cancer caused by exposures to arsenic via drinking well water for residents from the Black Foot Disease endemic area in Taiwan 34.
p5917
aVAnother example is the increased incidence of cancer in the lungs, nose, and larynx for workers exposed to nickel in the factory 15.
p5918
aVHeavy metals in soils may exert their effects on human health via the food grown on them.
p5919
aVVegetable or fruit growing on soils containing a high amount of heavy metals were found to contain higher levels of heavy metals 67, too, which may put people eating them under a higher risk of cancer development, if the metal is proved a carcinogen.
p5920
aVThe distribution of a certain kind of heavy metal in the environment is determined by both the nature and human activities.
p5921
aVThe advances in human technology may put the latter one a more important and decisive factor 8.
p5922
aVOral cancer (OC) is one of the fastest growing malignancies in Taiwan 9.
p5923
aVIn 1982, its incidence was at 5.12 per 105 men and 1.54 per 105 women per year.
p5924
aVIn 2001, these rates increased to 27.04 and 3.17 per 105 for men and women, respectively, which were an alarming 5.3-fold increase for men and a two-fold increase for women in a span of only two decades.
p5925
aVIt is ranked as the fourth most common type of cancer in men, as well as the leading type of cancer that causes death in the same gender between the ages 25 and 44.
p5926
aVIn contrast, in the United states of America, the United Kingdom, Brazil and many other countries 101112, the incidence and mortality of OC were either stable or in decline in the past 2 to 4 decades.
p5927
aVIt is therefore urgent for local scholars to understand the causes behind the opposite trend in Taiwan.
p5928
aVOur previous study 9 showed that the incidence rate of OC in Changhua, at 45.07 per 105 people per year, was the highest among the 23 counties in Taiwan in 2001.
p5929
aVIn two decades, from 1982 to 2001, Changhua saw an alarming 6.3-fold increase in the incidence of OC among men.
p5930
aVWe plotted the incidence against the prevalence of cigarette smoking (CS) and betel quid chewing (BQC), and found that Changhua stood out as the only significant outlier, with an exceptionally high incidence but a mediocre prevalence of BQC and CS.
p5931
aVThese results suggest to us existence of a new risk factor in this area.
p5932
aVWe also found that 13 the age at diagnosis and the prognosis of OC in Changhua were related to the patient's residential area.
p5933
aVThe mean age at diagnosis was 53.1 and 52.8 for patients living in the north and middle area of Changhua, while that for patients living in the south area was 55.1.
p5934
aVMeanwhile, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test show patients living in the north and middle area of Changhua have a poorer long-term prognosis.
p5935
aVMoreover, the density of electroplating factories is significantly higher in the north and middle areas of Changhua.
p5936
aVSince heavy metals are utilized in the industry, and many of these metals are known carcinogens 1415, it is important to know if exposures to heavy metals are a factor in the development of OC.
p5937
aVWe also found that OC at Changhua is not limited among factory workers.
p5938
aVMost of the OC patients are not working in the electroplating factories.
p5939
aVTherefore, a medium via which people can be exposed to heavy metals may be in existence.
p5940
aVAlthough an abundance of literatures have addressed the carcinogenic effects of various kinds of heavy metal 1, heavy metal and oral cancer has rarely been addressed.
p5941
aVThe purpose of this study is to explore the spatial relationship between OC and the heavy metal concentrations in soils.
p5942
aVOur findings show that the OC incidences in Taiwan are geographically and statistically related to the arsenic and nickel concentrations in farm soils.
p5943
aVThe data from the cancer registration were provided by the Department of Health in Taiwan and contain records of 22,083 patients, who were diagnosed with malignant oral cavity cancer (Appendix) from Jan 1982 to Dec 2002.
p5944
aVThe residency of these patients is provided in the records of the registry.
p5945
aVThe data on the personal income 16, factory density 17], factory distribution and types of industry, and other socioeconomic variables were provided by the Financial Data Center, Department of Finance &amp; Statistics, Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taiwan.
p5946
aVThe data were retrieved from a survey conducted in 2002 18 by the Department of Health.
p5947
aVIt surveyed the prevalence rates of BQC and CS in randomly selected subjects, including 13,086 men and 12,473 women.
p5948
aVThe measurement of heavy metal concentrations in the surface (0~15 cm) farm soils were retrieved from a national survey 19, which includes the following 8 metals: arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) 20.
p5949
aVThe total concentration of extractable As and Hg in the soil were measured with the aqua regia method, and the concentration of the other six kinds of heavy metals was obtained with the 0.1 N HCl extraction method.
p5950
aVBy averaging the results of different samples within the same township/precinct, we obtained a value to represent the metal concentration in a certain township/precinct.
p5951
aVExcept a few alpine areas with very small population and a few metropolitan areas which have very few farms, totally 316 townships/precincts have the measurement of the metal concentrations.
p5952
aVThe population in each township/precinct in 2002 is obtained from the Central Institute of Statistics in Taiwan 21.
p5953
aVThe population of the 316 townships/precincts in 2002 was 20.4 millions.
p5954
aVAnalyses were conducted for a subset of 296 townships/precincts, which comprises 83% of the population of the 316 townships (Figure 1).
p5955
aVThe subset was defined by excluding 3 major metropolitan areas: Taipei City, Taichung City, and Kaohsiung City, which have much higher population density (over 6 thousands people per square mile) than the other cities and more immigrants from other areas.
p5956
aVMany precincts in these metropolitan areas have very few farms, and the measurement of metal concentration in farm soil is not available.
p5957
aVThe inter-quartile size of the population in each of the studied township/precinct range from 19,120 (25th percentile) to 64,540 (75th percentile) people.
p5958
aVEach townships/precincts was treated as a unit in the analysis.
p5959
aVWe first calculated the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of OC based on the year 2000 age distribution of the standard population projected by WHO, and showed the incidence for men and for women in Taiwan in figure 2A and 2B.
p5960
aVIn the dataset on the public behavior toward health, 177 townships/precincts have a sample size more than 50, and subjects from these 177 townships/precincts contributed 97.4% of the questionnaires.
p5961
aVWe first calculated the prevalence rates of BQC and CS at these 177 townships/precincts, and the rates at the rest townships/precincts were estimated by mean substitution, neighborhood method and indicator Kriging method 2223.
p5962
aVWe found that similar results were obtained with either method.
p5963
aVAs to the concentrations of the 8 heavy metals in farm soils from the 316 townships/precincts, they were retrievable from the dataset.
p5964
aVWe then used GIS to map 2425 the features, and conducted a step-wise regression to explore the associations between ASIR and the 14 explanatory variables (i.e., income, age, density of factory, aboriginal residency areas, prevalence of BQC and CS, and concentrations in the soils for the eight kinds of heavy metal).
p5965
aVThe conventional multiple regression was applied at first, and Moran's I 26. statistics and residual plot were used to examine the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals.
p5966
aVIf the assumptions of conventional regression are violated, spatial regression is then applied.
p5967
aVThe spatial models including Conditional Autoregressive Model (CAR) and spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model 26 were used in the analysis.
p5968
aVThe neighbor objects in spatial regression were created by distance based method, using centroid to centroid definition with a radius of 10 kilometers to construct spatial proximity matrix.
p5969
aVWe noted that to use a radius of 20 km or 5 km will result in unrealistic number of neighbors for each object.
p5970
aVThe analyses were performed using software S-plus with spatial module.
p5971
aVAfter the important explanatory variables were identified, each of them was stratified into 3 levels, with each level containing roughly one third of the population.
p5972
aVWe then used histograms to explore the impact of each variable, and the interactions between them.
p5973
aVThe secular trends of the incidence at different levels of the explanatory variables were also investigated.
p5974
aVIn figure 3A we used the levels 3.4 and 6.4 (mg/kg), which divided the townships into 3 groups with each group containing roughly 1/3 of the population.
p5975
aVIn figure 4A, we used two more cut points, 4.7 and 10.9 mg/kg, to further divide the middle and high concentration groups, where 4.7 is the medium of the middle group, and 10.9 was used as the cutoff level by the Environment Protection Administration (EPA) of Taiwan to classify the farms with a significantly higher arsenic concentration in soils.
p5976
aVSimilarly, we used (1.65, 2.15, 2.8, 11) as the cut-points of nickel concentration in figure 4B, and (1.65, 2.8) as the cut-points for figure 3B.
p5977
aVEPA used 11 mg/kg as the cutoff value to classify the farms with high nickel concentration.
p5978
aVAs has shown in figure 2.
p5979
aVOC is a male-dominant disease in Taiwan, with male patients constituting 88% 9,
p5980
aVwe focused on male OC in later analysis, and will give explanations to the male dominance in the discussion.
p5981
aVAreas with high incidence are located in mid-Taiwan, along the west coast, where the Changhua County is located (Figure 1).
p5982
aVThe prevalence of BQC and CS are shown in figure 4C and 4D.
p5983
aVAreas with high prevalence of BQC are located along the east coast, which is the main habitat of the aboriginal people, among whom BQC is a tradition and a social rite.
p5984
aVFor CS, areas with high prevalence are also located along the east coast.
p5985
aVA high association between BQC and CS is an observed and documented phenomenon in Taiwan 27.
p5986
aVBased on these maps, it is discernible that the areas with high incidence of OC only partially correspond to areas with high prevalence of BQC or CS.
p5987
aVBecause of strong spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of regular regressions, we used the spatial linear regression to relate the incidence of OC at each township/precinct to the heavy metal concentrations, using variables like age, income, density of factory, aboriginal residency areas, prevalence of BQC and CS as possible confounders.
p5988
aVThe conventional multiple regression was applied at first, and the test based Moran's I (0.407) with p-value &lt; 0.001 suggests the existence of spatial autocorrelation of the residuals.
p5989
aVThe CAR and SAR spatial regression were then applied.
p5990
aVBoth methods come out with very similar estimation results and have small Moran's I's with p-values &gt; 0.05, though CAR has smaller Moran's I than the SAR.
p5991
aVTable 1 shows the results obtained from CAR method, including the full model with all factors, and the concise model after stepwise variable selection procedure.
p5992
aVIn both models, nickel and arsenic appeared as the only two metals with a statistical significance.
p5993
aVResults are similar under different imputation methods for the prevalence of BQC or CS.
p5994
aVThe following concise model was obtained under neighborhood method:
p5995
aVwhere ASIR, BQC, As and Ni and Aboriginal stand for the age-standardized incidence rate, prevalence of betel quid chewing, nickel and arsenic concentration (mg/kg) in farm soils, and aboriginal residency (defined at the footnote of Table 1), respectively.
p5996
aVThe prevalence of CS is not included due to a high correlation with prevalence of BQC.
p5997
aVThe spatial regression was applied on the data with various interpolating methods for the BQC/CS prevalence, as well as the data without any interpolating.
p5998
aVAll came out with similar results that BQC, Ni and As are significantly correlated with the ASIR of OC.
p5999
aVIn figure 4A and 4B, the concentrations of arsenic and nickel in farm soils in Taiwan are shown.
p6000
aVAreas with high arsenic concentration in farm soils are widespread over the mid- and southern part of the west coast.
p6001
aVFor nickel, areas with high concentrations are limited to two areas: Changhua, an agriculture county in the mid-part of the west coast, and Hualien, on the east coast, a mountainous county.
p6002
aVBecause BQC is the most important risk factor for OC in Taiwan 27282930, we went on to study the interaction between BQC and arsenic or nickel in farm soils and their effects on the incidence of OC.
p6003
aVIn figure 3A and 3B, their effects on the incidence of male OC in the non-metropolitan areas is shown.
p6004
aVWhether an area had a low, medium, or high prevalence of BQC, both nickel and arsenic in farm soils have an effect on the incidence of oral cancer.
p6005
aVIn figure 3C, we show the effects of both metals on the OC incidence.
p6006
aVA steady increase in the incidence from areas with low concentration to areas with high concentration of arsenic in farm soils is observed.
p6007
aVOn the other hand, if we focus on the areas with low, medium, or high content of soil arsenic, the concentration of soil nickel still has a marked effect on the incidence of OC, indicating that these two metals may play important roles in the development of OC.
p6008
aVResults from the corresponding three-way ANOVA (not shown here) of incidence rate classified by Ni, As and BQC indicate that all three are significant (p-value &lt; 0.05).
p6009
aVNo interaction among them reaches the level of significance, indicating that each factor alone is important.
p6010
aVThe incidences of male OC in the non-metropolitan areas shown in figure 5.
p6011
aVA steady increase in the incidence of male OC was observed in the study period, with higher incidences in areas with higher nickel concentrations.
p6012
aVAs to the effect of arsenic, areas in the upper third level has the highest incidence, but we did not detect marked differences in the incidence between the areas in the mid and lower third levels.
p6013
aVExposures to hazardous materials in the home, the workplace, and the community can cause or exacerbate a multitude of diseases 31.
p6014
aVPhysicians commonly treat the sequelae of these diseases; however, unless we start to recognize the connection between the occurrence of diseases and exposures to hazardous elements, treatment of the manifestations rather than the cause at best only ameliorate the condition.
p6015
aVAt worst, ignoring the effect of hazardous exposures may both lead to failure of treatment and failure to recognize a public health problem with widespread significance.
p6016
aVNowadays, environmental exposures are increasingly being associated with deterioration in health whose outcomes range from the subclinical to the clinically catastrophic 31.
p6017
aVDespite that many countries have observed a steady or declining OC incidence in the past decades, it is the fastest growing malignancy in Taiwan.
p6018
aVWe were interested to know that the State of Nevada has also witnessed a trend of increase in the OC incidence, opposite to most other states in the United States of America10.
p6019
aVIt is a surprising coincidence that experts in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas found that there was a severe environmental pollution with heavy metals resulted from widespread and massive landscaping 8.
p6020
aVFor the Changhua County in Taiwan, OC is ranked as the third most common type of cancer in men 32.
p6021
aVWe found that the prognoses of OC patients diagnosed and treated at the Changhua Christian Hospital13 are associated with their residencies.
p6022
aVPatients who live in areas with higher density of electroplating factories survive shorter, and in areas with lower density, longer.
p6023
aVAs stated above, treatment of the manifestations rather than the cause at best can ameliorate the condition.
p6024
aVBQC and CS are the established risk factors of oral cancer in Taiwan.
p6025
aVA high association between these two habits is also reported 27.
p6026
aVThe Government in Taiwan has long recognized the causal relationship between OC and BQC.
p6027
aVIn fact, a vigorous campaign has been waged to combat OC through public education.
p6028
aVPeople are well informed of the risk accompanying BQC, and chewers are encouraged to abstain from the habit or at least undergo regular check-ups with the dentist for detection of early oral cancer.
p6029
aVHowever, the incidence of OC keeps increasing in recent years.
p6030
aVIf we simply look at the prevalence of BQC and CS and the incidence of OC on the map, it is hard to miss the discord.
p6031
aVWhere the prevalence of BQC and CS is high does not correspond to where the incidence of OC is high.
p6032
aVSomething may be amiss in the picture of our understanding of the pathogenesis of OC in Taiwan.
p6033
aVOur previous studies 913 make us suspect that local factors may be present and prompt us to identify the underlying connections with hazardous exposures.
p6034
aVArsenic is a known carcinogen causing many types of cancer 14.
p6035
aVHazardous exposures to arsenic present in artesian well water are considered a major cause of the Black Foot Disease (BFD) and other types of cancer on the southwest coast of Taiwan.
p6036
aVAs has shown in figure 4, concentrations of arsenic in farm soils in areas endemic for BFD are also higher than those in other areas on the island.
p6037
aVThe government in Taiwan has already completed the construction required to supply the area inflicted with BFD with tap water in the early 1980s.
p6038
aVHowever, despite the disappearance of BFD, the incidence of cancer reported to be associated with hazardous exposures to arsenic remains very high 3334.
p6039
aVThese facts made us wonder if arsenic in farm soils may be playing a role similar to that in artesian well water.
p6040
aVNickel is also a well-recognized carcinogen, which is known to increase the incidence of nasal cancer and lung cancer among those with hazardous exposures during purification in the factory 3536.
p6041
aVHowever, most, if not all authors in the literature1 described an association between exposures of factory workers and the incidence of a particular type of cancer among them.
p6042
aVA widespread effect of this heavy metal on the public in the community, be it small or large, has not been described yet.
p6043
aVHere we present a strong association between concentrations of arsenic and nickel in farm soils, and the incidence of OC.
p6044
aVFarm soils can be regarded as either an emitter or a receiver of the environmental toxin.
p6045
aVAs an emitter, the soil may release toxin to crops, to the groundwater, or to air; as a receiver, it does not matter whether the toxin was initially in the air or water; the residuals eventually settle onto the soil.
p6046
aVTherefore the heavy metal concentration in farm soils can fairly reflect the amount of heavy metal present in the environment, and the risk that the residents in the vicinity are exposed to 37.
p6047
aVA question arises then: How do these known carcinogens in farm soils enter the human body?
p6048
aVOne possible route is via the food grown on them.
p6049
aVVegetable or fruit growing on soils with high contents of heavy metals were found to contain higher levels of heavy metals 67,
p6050
aVwhich may put the people eating them under a higher risk of cancer development, as a result.
p6051
aVNote that in this study we excluded people living in the 3 major metropolitan areas; people in these areas are more likely to have access to farm products produced far away.
p6052
aVA limitation of this study is that the residency does not necessarily reflect the lifetime exposure, migration may happen.
p6053
aVHowever, the trend here is from the country to the city and the three big cities here are excluded in the analysis.
p6054
aVAnother limitation is that the BQC/CS prevalence are available for only 177 townships and the prevalence for the rest townships were obtained by interpolating methods.
p6055
aVTo verify our results, we tried various interpolating methods as well as the non-interpolating data, and all led to the same conclusion that BQC, Ni and As are significantly associated with OC incidence.
p6056
aVIn addition to these 3 factors, we also noted the indicator variable of aboriginal residency is significant in some concise models.
p6057
aVAreas classified as aboriginal residency have a higher OC incidence rate.
p6058
aVHowever, this variable is strongly confounded with a few variables like age and income, and its effect needs further investigation.
p6059
aVHere we focused mainly on the male OC, and the female OC is not addressed.
p6060
aVBecause only 12% of the 22,083 cases in study are women, the small number will make cases in each township/precinct too few for statistical analyses.
p6061
aVOn the other hand, a great disparity of BQC prevalence between the genders in Taiwan 38 also makes the estimation of the prevalence of BQC in women difficult.
p6062
aVThough BQC is prevalent in men, women rarely practice it.
p6063
aVThis difference may be related to culture and the image a chewer creates in the public.
p6064
aVThe results here support our hypothesis: BQC is the inducer, while arsenic and nickel act as promoters in the carcinogenesis of OC.
p6065
aVOf course, it is still a hypothesis; more work is needed to prove or disprove it, and we are currently working on it.
p6066
aVA past study had found an association between the density of electroplating factories and prognosis of oral cancer.
p6067
aVThis report further extended the finding: beside the two established risk factors, cigarette smoking and betel quid chewing, concentrations of nickel and arsenic in farm soils are also correlated with incidence of oral cancer in Taiwan.
p6068
aVWe are now studying serum levels of heavy metal in patients and controls to ascertain the evidence of the novel risk factors.
p6069
aVHopefully through the works, more efficient preventive procedures can implemented for public health.
p6070
aVHexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a human carcinogen after inhalation exposure.
p6071
aVHumans also ingest Cr(VI) from contaminated drinking water and soil; however, limited data exist on the oral toxicity and carcinogenicity of Cr(VI).
p6072
aVWe characterized the chronic oral toxicity and carcinogenicity of Cr(VI) in rodents.
p6073
aVThe National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted 2-year drinking water studies of Cr(VI) (as sodium dichromate dihydrate) in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice.
p6074
aVCr(VI) exposure resulted in increased incidences of rare neoplasms of the squamous epithelium that lines the oral cavity (oral mucosa and tongue) in male and female rats, and of the epithelium lining the small intestine in male and female mice.
p6075
aVCr(VI) exposure did not affect survival but resulted in reduced mean body weights and water consumption, due at least in part to poor palatability of the dosed water.
p6076
aVCr(VI) exposure resulted in transient microcytic hypochromic anemia in rats and microcytosis in mice.
p6077
aVNonneoplastic lesions included diffuse epithelial hyperplasia in the duodenum and jejunum of mice and histiocytic cell infiltration in the duodenum, liver, and mesenteric and pancreatic lymph nodes of rats and mice.
p6078
aVCr(VI) was carcinogenic after administration in drinking water to male and female rats and mice.
p6079
aVHexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] compounds are classified as human carcinogens [Cohen et al.
p6080
aV1993; International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 1990; National Toxicology Program (NTP) 1998], based on increased incidences of lung cancers in animals and humans after inhalation exposures.
p6081
aVInhalation exposures occur primarily in occupational settings.
p6082
aVThe highest exposure to Cr(VI) occurs occupationally among workers involved in chrome plating, chromate production, and stainless steel welding.
p6083
aVAs a result of industrial contamination, concentrations of Cr(VI) in the drinking water and soil may be higher than concentrations resulting from natural sources alone, causing ingestion of higher concentrations by populations residing near these locations than by the general population.
p6084
aVA Cr(VI) concentration of 580 \u03bcg/L was found in a ground-water monitoring well in Hinkley, California (Pellerin and Booker 2000).
p6085
aVDetectable levels of Cr(VI) have been reported in approximately 30% of the drinking water sources monitored in California, which has a 1 \u03bcg/L detection limit for purposes of reporting [California Department of Public Health (CDPH) 2007a]; 86% of those sources had peak concentrations of \u2264 10 \u03bcg/L.
p6086
aVThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a maximum contaminant level of 100 \u03bcg/L for total chromium in drinking water (U.S. EPA 2003).
p6087
aVThe limit in California and numerous other states is 50 \u03bcg/L of total chromium in drinking water (CDPH 2007b).
p6088
aVThe toxicity of Cr(VI) in humans and animals has been reviewed extensively (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 2000; Costa 1997; Costa and Klein 2006; U.S. EPA 1998).
p6089
aVWe identified only one lifetime animal carcinogenicity study in the literature in which Cr(VI) was administered in the drinking water (Borneff et al.
p6090
aV1968).
p6091
aVFurther analysis of the data (Sedman et al.
p6092
aV2006) revealed that in three generations of female NMRI mice, the combined incidences of benign and malignant forestomach neoplasms were increased over controls;
p6093
aVthis study has several limitations, including high early mortality in the F0 generation as a result of ectromelia (mouse-pox) virus.
p6094
aVA review of the few epidemiologic studies that evaluated populations that were exposed to Cr(VI) in drinking water or in soil or slag fill concluded that these studies did not provide definitive evidence of an increase in cancer incidence or mortality rates (Proctor et al.
p6095
aV2002).
p6096
aVHowever, a retrospective mortality study in China found higher incidences of lung and stomach neoplasms in people living near a chromium smelting plant compared with the general population (Zhang and Li 1987); statistical analysis of these data supported this conclusion (Beaumont et al.
p6097
aV2008; Sedman et al.
p6098
aV2006).
p6099
aVBecause of concerns over its presence in drinking water source supplies, its potential health effects, including carcinogenicity, and the lack of adequate carcinogenicity studies by the oral route, the California Congressional Delegation, California Environmental Protection Agency, and California Department of Health Services nominated Cr(VI) to the NTP for toxicity and carcinogenicity testing.
p6100
aVWe selected sodium dichromate dihydrate (SDD) for testing because it is the primary base material for the production of chromium compounds, is widely used in industrial applications, and is the most water-soluble chromate.
p6101
aVThe NTP previously conducted 3-month toxicity studies of SDD administered in drinking water (NTP 2007).
p6102
aVF344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, or 1,000 mg SDD/L.
p6103
aVIn these studies, both rats and mice had reduced body weight and water consumption and microcytic hypochromic anemia; the anemia was more severe in rats.
p6104
aVExposure-related histopathologic lesions included ulcers, epithelial hyper plasia, and squamous metaplasia in the glandular stomach of rats; epithelial hyperplasia of the duodenum of mice; and histiocytic cellular infiltration in the liver, duodenum, and pancreatic lymph node of rats and in the duodenum and mesenteric lymph node of mice.
p6105
aVWe selected exposure concentrations for the 2-year studies of SDD after review of the 3-month toxicity study data.
p6106
aVThe highest exposure concentration for the 2-year studies in rats and mice was limited by toxicity observed in the 3-month studies (NTP 2007), and a wider spacing of exposure concentrations was selected to extend the dose\u2013response curve.
p6107
aVWe added an additional low-exposure group [5 mg Cr(VI)/L] to the 2-year studies to provide a concentration closer to human exposure through contaminated drinking water.
p6108
aVIn this report we present the primary findings of the NTP chronic oral toxicity and carcinogenesis studies of Cr(VI) in male and female rats and mice; a more detailed report on these studies is available as an NTP technical report (NTP 2008a).
p6109
aVSDD (CAS 7789-12-0) was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI).
p6110
aVThe purity was determined using differential scanning calorimetry, titration of the dichromate ion with sodium thiosulfate and potassium ferrocyanide, speciation of the chromium ions using liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and potentiometric titrimetric analysis with sodium thiosulfate.
p6111
aVBased on these analyses, the overall purity was \u2265 99.7%.
p6112
aVThe dose formulations were prepared approximately every 2 weeks by mixing SDD with tap water and stored at room temperature in sealed containers protected from light.
p6113
aVThe dose formulations were stable for 42 days under these conditions.
p6114
aVPeriodic analysis by ultraviolet spectroscopy with detection at 350\u2013390 nm confirmed that all dose formulations varied by &lt; 10% of the target concentrations.
p6115
aVThe studies were conducted at Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL).
p6116
aVMale and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY).
p6117
aVRats and mice were quarantined for 14 days, and were 6\u20137 weeks of age at the beginning of the studies.
p6118
aVAnimals were distributed randomly into groups of approximately equal initial mean body weights and identified by tail tattoo.
p6119
aVRats and mice were housed one (male mice), three (male rats), or five (female rats and mice) to a cage.
p6120
aVFeed (irradiated NTP-2000 wafers; Zeigler Brothers, Inc., Gardners, PA) and tap water were available ad libitum.
p6121
aVAnimals were killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation.
p6122
aVAnimal use was in accordance with the U.S. Public Health Service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council 1996).
p6123
aVAnimals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering.
p6124
aVThese studies were conducted in compliance with the Food and Drug Administration Good Laboratory Practice Regulations (Food and Drug Administration 1987).
p6125
aVGroups of 50 male and 50 female rats and mice were exposed to SDD in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 14.3, 57.3, 172, or 516 mg/L (male and female rats and female mice) or 0, 14.3, 28.6, 85.7, or 257.4 mg/L (male mice) for 105\u2013106 weeks.
p6126
aVTable 1 shows corresponding Cr(VI) concentrations.
p6127
aVWater consumption was recorded weekly for the first 13 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter, with each water consumption measurement covering a 7-day period.
p6128
aVAnimals were weighed initially, weekly for the first 13 weeks, at 4-week intervals thereafter, and at the end of the studies.
p6129
aVAnimals were observed twice daily and clinical findings were recorded at 4-week intervals beginning at week 5.
p6130
aVComplete necropsies and microscopic examinations were performed on all core study rats and mice.
p6131
aVAt necropsy, all organs and tissues were examined for grossly visible lesions, and all protocol-required tissues were fixed and preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin (eyes were initially fixed in Davidson\u2019s solution), trimmed and processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to a thickness of 4\u20136 \u03bcm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for microscopic examination.
p6132
aVFor all paired organs (e.g., adrenal gland, kidney, ovary), samples from each organ were examined.
p6133
aVThe entire gastrointestinal tract was opened and potential lesions were collected for microscopic evaluation.
p6134
aVOral mucosa and tongue are not protocol-required tissues; however, because gross lesions in these tissues were diagnosed as neoplasms, the oral mucosa and tongue of all animals were evaluated histologically.
p6135
aVAdditional details regarding the pathology data generation, quality assurance review, and NTP pathology working group are available in the NTP technical report (NTP 2008a).
p6136
aVDetails of these review procedures have been described, in part, by Maronpot and Boorman (1982) and Boorman et al.
p6137
aV(1985).
p6138
aVFor subsequent analyses of the pathology data, the decision of whether to evaluate the diagnosed lesions for each tissue type separately or combined was based on the guidelines of McConnell et al.
p6139
aV(1986).
p6140
aVHematology and clinical chemistry were evaluated in additional groups of 10\u201316 male rats and female mice on days 4 (male rats only) and 22 and at 3, 6, and 12 months.
p6141
aVAt these time points, rats and mice were anesthetized with CO2/O2, and blood was taken from the retroorbital sinus.
p6142
aVWe estimated the probability of survival by the product-limit procedure of Kaplan and Meier (1958).
p6143
aVAnimals found dead of other than natural causes or missing were censored from the survival analyses; animals dying from natural causes were not censored.
p6144
aVStatistical analyses for possible dose-related effects on survival used Cox\u2019s (1972) method for testing two groups for equality and Tarone\u2019s (1975) life table test to identify dose-related trends.
p6145
aVAll reported p-values for the survival analyses are two sided.
p6146
aVWe used the poly-k test (Bailer and Portier 1988; Piegorsch and Bailer 1997; Portier and Bailer 1989) to assess neoplasm and nonneoplastic lesion incidence.
p6147
aVThis test is a survival-adjusted quantal-response procedure that modifies the Cochran-Armitage linear trend test to take survival differences into account; we used a value of k = 3 in the analysis of site-specific lesions.
p6148
aVTests of significance included pairwise comparisons of each exposed group with controls and a test for an overall exposure-related trend.
p6149
aVWe used continuity-corrected poly-3 tests in the analysis of lesion incidence, and reported p-values are one sided.
p6150
aVSub- and supralinear trends across doses for intestinal tumor rates were assessed with lack-of-fit tests for the linear regression of intestinal tumor rate on dose (Neter et al.
p6151
aV1996).
p6152
aVWe analyzed hematology and clinical chemistry data, which typically have skewed distributions, using the modified (Dunn 1964; Williams 1986) nonparametric multiple comparison methods of Shirley (1977).
p6153
aVWe used Jonckheere\u2019s test (Jonckheere 1954) to assess the significance of the dose-related trends and to determine whether a trend-sensitive test (Shirley 1977; Williams 1986) was more appropriate for pairwise comparisons than a test that does not assume a monotonic dose-related trend (Dunn 1964; Dunnett 1955).
p6154
aVBefore statistical analysis, we examined extreme values identified by the outlier test of Dixon and Massey (1957) and eliminated implausible values from the analysis.
p6155
aVMale and female rats showed significantly increased incidences of highly aggressive neoplasms of the squamous epithelium that lines the oral cavity (oral mucosa and tongue) at 516 mg/L (Table 2).
p6156
aVSpecifically, we observed increases for squamous cell carcinoma in the oral mucosa and for squamous cell papilloma or carcinoma (combined) of the oral mucosa or tongue of male and female rats at 516 mg/L.
p6157
aVThere were squamous cell carcinomas in the oral mucosa of two 172 mg/L female rats; this incidence exceeded the historical control ranges for drinking water studies and for all routes of administration (Table 2).
p6158
aVWe did not observe nonneoplastic lesions in the oral mucosa.
p6159
aVMicroscopically, the squamous cell carcinomas were highly invasive, irregular masses.
p6160
aVTypically, the carcinomas appeared to originate in the oral mucosa of the palate adjacent to the upper molar teeth (Figure 1A, B); in some animals they invaded the tongue, Harderian gland, and the soft tissues surrounding the nose, and in one case it penetrated the maxilla and invaded the brain.
p6161
aVThe squamous cell papillomas of the oral mucosa and tongue were exophytic masses that projected from the mucosa and consisted of irregular papillary proliferations of mature squamous epithelium supported by a core of fibrovascular stroma (Figure 1C).
p6162
aVBoth males and females showed a clear exposure concentration response for increased incidences of adenoma or carcinoma (combined) at all sites (combined) of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, or ileum; Table 3).
p6163
aVThese increases were significant at 85.7 and 257.4 mg/L in males and at 172 and 516 mg/L females, the two highest exposure concentrations in each sex.
p6164
aVIn addition, the incidence in 57.3 mg/L females exceeded the historical control ranges for drinking water studies and for all routes of administration (Table 3).
p6165
aVThese increases were driven primarily by significant increases in the incidences of adenoma of the duodenum in 257.4 mg/L males and in 172 and 516 mg/L females; the number of mice with multiple adenomas was also significantly increased at the high dose in both sexes (data not shown).
p6166
aVIn females, the incidence of carcinoma in the duodenum was significantly increased at 516 mg/L.
p6167
aVIn the jejunum, the incidence of adenoma was increased in 516 mg/L females.
p6168
aVFor both males and females, we tested the combined incidence of adenoma and carcinoma for departures from a linear dose response (data not shown).
p6169
aVFor males, the trend was linear, with no significant departure from linearity.
p6170
aVFor females, the response was supralinear with a significant departure from linearity.
p6171
aVAdenomas were discrete, broad based, focally extensive, plaquelike areas of proliferating glandular epithelium that thickened the mucosa and protruded into the lumen (Figure 1D).
p6172
aVCarcinomas were sessile, plaque-like neoplasms distinguished from adenomas by extensive invasion and effacement of the mucosa, underlying submucosa, and muscle layers (Figure 1E).
p6173
aVLow incidences of focal epithelial hyperplasia occurred in the duodenum of exposed male and female mice (Table 4).
p6174
aVAlthough the increased incidences were not exposure concentration related or statistically significant, we considered this lesion a preneoplastic lesion related to exposure to SDD because of its morphologic similarities to adenoma.
p6175
aVFocal epithelial hyperplasias were focal areas of proliferating glandular epithelium distinguished from adenomas because they were smaller, less discrete, and confined to the superficial mucosal epithelium (Figure 1F).
p6176
aVThe incidences of diffuse epithelial hyperplasia were significantly increased in the duodenum of all exposed groups of male and female mice (Table 4).
p6177
aVIn the jejunum, the incidence of diffuse epithelial hyperplasia was significantly increased in 516 mg/L females.
p6178
aVIn contrast to those of the controls (Figure 1G), the duodenums of exposed mice had short, broad, blunt villi and generalized mucosal hypercellularity that was particularly prominent in the villi (Figure 1H).
p6179
aVWe found significant increases in histiocytic cell infiltration in the duodenum and mesenteric lymph node of rats and mice of both sexes, in the jejunum of female mice, in the liver of male and female rats and female mice, and in the pancreatic lymph node of female rats and male and female mice;
p6180
aVthese data are presented in detail in the NTP technical report (NTP 2008a).
p6181
aVThe infiltrating histiocytes were morphologically similar in tissues of rats and mice.
p6182
aVHistiocytic infiltrates were characterized by the presence of individual, small clusters, and sometimes syncytia of large histiocytes (macrophages) within the sinusoids of the liver and lymph nodes and the lamina propria at the tips of the duodenal and jejunal villi.
p6183
aVIn the lymph nodes, the histiocytic infiltrates occurred as expansive sheets that in some cases replaced much of the lymph node parenchyma.
p6184
aVThe biological significance and cause of the histiocytic cellular infiltrates are unknown.
p6185
aVIn rats, an exposure-related decrease in mean cell volumes, mean cell hemoglobin concentrations, hematocrits, hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte counts and increase in reticulocyte counts were indicative of erythrocyte microcytic, hypochromic, responsive anemia;
p6186
aVthese data are presented in detail in the NTP technical report (NTP 2008a).
p6187
aVThe anemia was most prominent early in the study (22 days to 3 months).
p6188
aVMicroscopic evaluations of blood smears demonstrated increased poikilocytes, erythrocyte fragments/schizocytes, keratocytes, erythrocyte hypochromia, and microcytes that suggested increased erythrocyte injury or turnover.
p6189
aVThis effect was more prominent on day 22 and at 3 months than at 6 or 12 months, which may have been either a result of the animals adapting to exposure or a result of the decreased Cr(IV) ingestion per unit body weight with longer exposure durations.
p6190
aVMice demonstrated a similar, but less severe, effect on erythron.
p6191
aVSurvival, body weight, and water consumption data are presented in detail in the NTP technical report (NTP 2008a).
p6192
aVSurvival of exposed groups of male and female rats and mice was similar to that of the respective control groups.
p6193
aVMean body weights compared with controls were decreased in male and female rats and mice.
p6194
aVIn rats, mean body weights of 516 mg/L males and females were less than those of controls throughout the study and by the end of the study were 12% (males) or 11% (females) less than the controls.
p6195
aVMean body weights of 257.4 mg/L male mice were less than controls for the first 4 months of the study but were only slightly less (6%) by the end of the study.
p6196
aVMean body weights were less than the controls from months 3 to 12 in 172 mg/L female mice and from month 2 until the end of the study in 516 mg/L females.
p6197
aVBy the end of the study, mean body weights were &lt; 8% of controls in 172 mg/L females and 15% less in 516 mg/L females.
p6198
aVWe attributed the lower body weights partly to poor palatability of the dosed water and consequent reductions in water consumption rather than direct toxic effects of SDD exposure.
p6199
aVWater consumption by male and female rats and mice exposed to the two highest concentrations was that by the controls throughout the study.
p6200
aVNo clinical findings were attributed to SDD exposure in rats or mice.
p6201
aVWhen we adjusted water consumption for body weight (data not shown), dosed male and female rats and female mice drank approximately the same quantities of water per gram of body weight as did the controls after the first 20 weeks on study.
p6202
aVMale mice exposed to 257.4 mg/L drank less water per gram of body weight than did the controls throughout the study.
p6203
aVHumans are exposed to Cr(VI) through ingestion of contaminated water and soil;
p6204
aVhowever, few data exist on the oral toxicity and carcinogenicity of Cr(VI).
p6205
aVThe NTP conducted 3-month (NTP 2007) and 2-year (NTP 2008a) studies of SDD administered in the drinking water to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice, to provide data on the potential for toxic and carcinogenic effects after ingestion of Cr(VI).
p6206
aVChronic administration of SDD in drinking water did not affect survival or produce clinical signs of toxicity in rats or mice.
p6207
aVWe observed exposure-related reductions in body weight gain and water consumption for rats and mice in the highest exposure groups and attributed these changes partly to poor palatability of the dosed water.
p6208
aVSeveral lines of evidence suggest that the animals were not dehydrated, including analysis of the water consumption data normalized to body weight and the complete lack of clinical observations or hematologic or clinical chemistry effects (NTP 2008a) that typically indicate dehydration.
p6209
aVThe NTP concluded that the exposure concentration-related significant increases in epithelial neoplasms of the upper alimentary tract (oral cavity) in male and female rats and of the lower alimentary tract (small intestine) in male and female mice provided clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of SDD in male and female rats and mice.
p6210
aVWe based this conclusion on the increased neoplasm incidences relative to concurrent controls and the rarity of these neoplasms (Tables 2 and 3) in historical controls.
p6211
aVIn both rats and mice, this conclusion was strengthened by similarities between the sexes.
p6212
aVWe observed no increases in nonneoplastic histopathologic lesions in either species suggestive of overt tissue damage due to the oxidant properties of Cr(VI).
p6213
aVWe observed obvious species differences in the target tissues for the development of neoplasms between rats and mice.
p6214
aVOf the 21 chemicals that have caused neoplasms of the oral cavity in NTP studies, none produced these neoplasms in male mice and only one, 1,2,3-trichloropropane (NTP 1993), produced oral cavity neoplasms in female mice, demonstrating a greater sensitivity to the development of oral cavity neoplasms in rats relative to mice.
p6215
aVAlthough slightly more common in rats, exposure-related increases of small intestine neoplasms in NTP studies are relatively rare in both species.
p6216
aVThe 2-year study of captan (National Cancer Institute 1977) is the only other study performed by the NTP in B6C3F1 mice in which both benign and malignant intestinal neoplasms of epithelial origin have been definitely attributed to chemical exposure (Shackelford and Elwell 1999).
p6217
aVAlthough the induction of neoplasms after exposure to SDD was limited to the alimentary tract, other data, including the toxicity to the erythron, provided evidence of systemic exposure and toxicity in male and female rats and mice exposed to Cr(VI) for 2 years.
p6218
aVWe also observed these lesions in the 3-month studies (NTP 2007).
p6219
aVAs part of the NTP 2-year studies on SDD (NTP 2008a) and chromium picolinate monohydrate (CPM) (NTP 2008b), which contains trivalent chromium [Cr(III)], total chromium content was determined in selected tissues and excreta of additional groups of male rats and female mice;

aVBecause Cr(VI) is reduced to Cr(III) both intracellularly and extracellularly and because analytical methods for the separate analysis of Cr(VI) or Cr(III) in biological samples are not available, the speciation of the tissue chromium after exposure to Cr(VI) was inferred by comparing total chromium concentrations in tissues of rats and mice exposed to similar doses of Cr(VI) or Cr(III).
p6223
aVAfter oral exposure to Cr(VI), chromium accumulation was correlated with exposure concentration and duration in several tissues (NTP 2008a).
p6224
aVSimilar doses of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) resulted in significantly higher tissue chromium concentrations with Cr(VI), indicating that chromium was absorbed and distributed to tissues of rats and mice as Cr(VI);
p6225
aVthese data are consistent with previous studies (Costa 1997; Costa and Klein 2006).
p6226
aVThe tissue concentration data were consistent with linear or supralinear (decreasing rate of response with increasing dose) dose responses.
p6227
aVIn the present studies, neither the oral cavity nor the small intestine was collected for total chromium analysis.
p6228
aVHowever, other reports suggest that Cr(VI) is also likely to be absorbed in the small intestine to a greater extent than Cr(III) (Donaldson and Barreras 1966; Febel et al.
p6229
aV2001).
p6230
aVReduction of Cr(VI) to the less permeable and bioavailable Cr(III) is thought to occur primarily in the stomach, as a mechanism of detoxification.
p6231
aVGastric reduction has been hypothesized to be efficient, such that oral exposure to Cr(VI) would not result in toxicity or carcinogenicity, except perhaps in the stomach (De Flora 2000; De Flora et al.
p6232
aV1997; Proctor et al.
p6233
aV2002).
p6234
aVNotably, in the 2-year study, no neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions were observed in the forestomach or glandular stomach of rats or mice.
p6235
aVHowever, the observed increases in neoplasms of the small intestine of mice and the toxicity to the erythron, histiocytic infiltration, and uptake of Cr(IV) into tissues of rats and mice suggest that, under the conditions of this study, at least a portion of the administered Cr(VI) was not reduced in the stomach.
p6236
aVThe significant disparity in the oral toxicity and carcinogenicity of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in rodents, including the absence of increases in neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions of the small intestine in rats or mice exposed to CPM (NTP 2008b), provides additional evidence that Cr(VI) is not completely reduced in the stomach and is responsible for the observed effects.
p6237
aVRecently, De Flora et al.
p6238
aV(2008) have suggested that increases in neoplasms of the small intestine observed in mice in the present study are the result of saturation of the gastric reduction capacity.
p6239
aVIf such a threshold mechanism were to occur, the dose that saturated the reducing capacity would likely represent an inflection point on a sublinear dose response curve, with doses above the inflection point demonstrating an increasing rate of response per unit dose, because unreduced chromium would be transported into tissues.
p6240
aVHowever, when we tested tissue concentration and mouse small intestine neoplasm data for linearity, data that were statistically nonlinear were supralinear (decreasing rate of response per unit dose).
p6241
aVA reduction capacity of about 84\u201388 mg Cr(VI)/day has been estimated for human gastric juice (De Flora et al.
p6242
aV1997).
p6243
aVThis estimate was based on reported values of human secretion of gastric fluid per day during fasting and after consuming three meals per day in combination with experimental data on reduction of Cr(VI)/mL of gastric juice produced during these periods.
p6244
aVSimilar data are not available for Cr(VI) reduction by mouse gastric juice.
p6245
aVHowever, assuming that Cr(VI) reduction is equally effective in mice and humans and that gastric secretion scales across species by body weight3/4, then the Cr(VI) reduction capacity of gastric juice from a 50-g mouse would be approximately 0.4 mg/day (~ 8 mg/kg/day).
p6246
aVThis value is greater than all of the male mouse doses and is nearly equivalent to the average daily dose of Cr(VI) in the high-dose group of female mice in the 2-year drinking water study of SDD (Table 1).
p6247
aVCollectively, the dose\u2013response analysis and gastric reduction capacity calculations indicate that SDD induced neoplasms in the small intestine of mice at dose levels that did not exceed the estimated Cr(VI) reducing capacity for gastric juices in mice.
p6248
aVCr(VI) is genotoxic in a number of in vitro and in vivo test systems (De Flora et al.
p6249
aV1990; IARC 1990);
p6250
aVhowever, the mechanisms of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity are not fully understood.
p6251
aVBecause Cr(VI) as chromate structurally resembles sulfate and phosphate, it can be taken up by all cells and organs throughout the body through non-specific anion transporters (Costa 1997).
p6252
aVOnce inside the cell, indirect DNA damage may occur through the generation of oxygen radicals during intracellular reduction of Cr(VI) through the more reactive pentavalent and tetravalent chromium to Cr(III) (O\u2019Brien et al.
p6253
aV2003);
p6254
aVhowever, evidence of the role of reactive oxygen species in the genotoxicity of Cr(VI) is inconsistent (Chorvatovicova et al.
p6255
aV1991; O\u2019Brien et al.
p6256
aV2003; Standeven and Wetterhahn 1991; Zhitkovich 2005).
p6257
aVCr(III), the final product of intracellular reduction of Cr(VI), has been shown to interact directly with DNA and other macromolecules to induce chromosomal alterations and mutational changes (O\u2019Brien et al.
p6258
aV2003; Quievryn et al.
p6259
aV2006; Reynolds et al.
p6260
aV2007; Zhitkovich 2005).
p6261
aVDNA adducts, DNA\u2013protein cross-links, and DNA interstrand cross-links have all been identified as products of Cr(III)\u2013DNA interactions.
p6262
aVThe relative contributions of the multiple, complex pathways of chromium-induced genotoxicity continue to be investigated.
p6263
aVIn conclusion, the NTP 2-year study of SDD is the first and only lifetime study that clearly demonstrates the carcinogenicity of Cr(VI) in rats and mice after oral exposure.
p6264
aVIn addition, the hematology, histologic and tissue distribution data provide evidence of systemic exposure in rats and mice.

aV1,3-Butadiene (BD) is an important industrial chemical and an environmental and occupational pollutant.
p6266
aVThe carcinogenicity of BD in rodents has been proved, but its carcinogenic and mutagenic molecular mechanism(s) are not fully elucidated in humans.
p6267
aVIn the present study, we compared the mutation frequencies and exon deletions of BD-exposed workers with that of control subjects in China to identify the characteristic mutations associated with BD exposure in the human HPRT (hypoxanthine\u2013guanine\u2013phosphoribosyltransferase) gene.
p6268
aVSeventy-four workers exposed to BD via inhalation and 157 matched controls were evaluated in Nanjing, China.
p6269
aVMolecular analysis of HPRT mutant T lymphocytes from BD-exposed workers and nonexposed control subjects was conducted to identify changes in the structure of the HPRT gene.
p6270
aVA total of 783 HPRT mutants were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction, in which 368 HPRT mutants were isolated from BD-exposed workers and 415 mutants from control subjects.
p6271
aVThe BD-exposed workers showed a higher mutation frequency (18.2 ± 9.4 × 10\u22126) than the control subjects (12.7 ± 7.3 × 10\u22126), but the difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.05).
p6272
aVThe frequency of exon deletions in BD-exposed workers (27.4%) was significantly higher than that in control subjects (12.5%) (p &lt; 0.05), which mainly included multiplex exon deletions (2\u20138 exons).
p6273
aVThe results of the present study suggest that BD should increase the frequency of large deletions of HPRT gene in human lymphocytes This change confirms and supports the previous findings in BD-exposed workers.

aV1,3-Butadiene (BD) is a highly volatile four-carbon chemical [C4H6; Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) no.

p6276
aVIt is a colorless, flammable gas that is widely used in the production of rubber and thermoplastic resins (Morrow 1990).
p6277
aVIts annual worldwide production is approximately 12 billion pounds, with 1.6 billion pounds produced in China (Cui 2003).
p6278
aVFollowing the United States, China is now the second leading producer and consumer of BD.
p6279
aVWhile useful for industry, BD is also an environmental air pollutant commonly found in automobile exhaust and cigarette smoke.
p6280
aVBD is a potent carcinogen at several sites in mice and rats after inhalation exposure.
p6281
aVResults from exposures in rodent studies indicate species differences in carcinogenic susceptibility between mice and rats: B6C3F1 mice were observed to be more sensitive to BD-induced carcinogenicity than Sprague-Dawley rats (Huff et al.
p6282
aV1985; Glaister and Owen 1990; Owen et al.
p6283
aV1987).
p6284
aVWhile the species and individual susceptibilities to DNA damage appear to differ greatly among mice, rats, and humans, it has been strongly suggested that the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of BD are related to its metabolic activation in several DNA-reactive intermediates, including 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), and 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (EB-diol) (Richardson et al.
p6285
aV1999).
p6286
aVAlthough research has shown that BD is a potent animal carcinogen, only a few studies have indicated that BD is a probable human carcinogen.
p6287
aVIn several epidemiologic studies, occupational exposure to BD is believed to be associated with excess mortality from lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers (Delzell et al.
p6288
aV1996; Divine and Hartman 1996).
p6289
aVOverall, the epidemiologic findings in BD-exposed workers suggest, but do not prove, that it is a human carcinogen (Zhang et al.
p6290
aV2004).
p6291
aVBD had been classified in Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 1992), but several regulatory agencies have recently considered raising its status to Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans) on the basis of the emerging data (Acquavella and Leonard 2001; IARC 1999; Morrow 2001).
p6292
aVIn a recent study of mortality among workers in the North American synthetic rubber industry, Cheng et al.
p6293
aV(2007) found the presence of a causal relationship between high cumulative exposure and high-intensity exposure to BD and leukemia.
p6294
aVThe weight of this evidence led to the recent classification of BD as a Group 1 known human carcinogen by the IARC Working Group (IARC, in press).
p6295
aVMeasuring mutation frequency (MF) at the hypoxanthine\u2013guanine\u2013phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus as an intermediate biomarker of BD carcinogenicity could be a powerful complement to traditional methods based on mortality and cancer incidence.
p6296
aVMF of the HPRT gene as a biomarker of genotoxicity has been investigated in BD-exposed humans, but the findings are inconsistent.
p6297
aVThree studies of BD-exposed workers in a Texas facility conducted by one laboratory indicated HPRT mutations in blood lymphocytes using the autoradiographic assay (Ammenheuser et al.
p6298
aV2001; Ward et al.
p6299
aV1994, 1996, 2001).
p6300
aVIn contrast, studies by Hayes et al.
p6301
aV(1996) and Tates et al.
p6302
aV(1996) using the T-cell cloning assay, failed to find significant increases in MF in blood lymphocytes of BD-exposed Chinese and Czech workers, even though BD exposure concentrations were similar to those detected in the Texas studies.
p6303
aVFurthermore, no increase in MF was found in the studies by Albertini et al.
p6304
aV(2001) using both the autoradiographic and T-cell cloning assays followed by the T-cell cloning assay in the follow-up HPRT mutation study (Albertini et al.
p6305
aV2007).
p6306
aVIt is important to note that in the early studies, the HPRT autoradiographic assay was consistently used, whereas in later and follow-up studies, the T-cell cloning assay or a combination of the two assays was used.
p6307
aVIt is possible that differences in the sensitivity of the methods and the target cells may have resulted in contradictory findings.
p6308
aVFor cytogenetic effects, the Czech study found a significant increase in chromosomal aberration frequencies and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in the BD-exposed workers (Sram et al.
p6309
aV1998).
p6310
aVHowever, subsequent studies by Sram et al.
p6311
aV(2004) and Albertini et al.
p6312
aV(2001, 2003, 2007) failed to confirm this finding.
p6313
aVThe current consensus on existing data is that BD does not cause cytogenetic effects in humans, most likely because DEB is not formed at sufficient levels in humans to play a role in its carcinogenicity.
p6314
aVThus, the remaining open question is whether BD is mutagenic in humans.
p6315
aVAt the BD exposure levels encountered in modern industry, a recent large study failed to demonstrate either induction of HPRT mutations or cytogenetic changes, even though measurable levels of electrophilic BD metabolites were produced in vivo (Albertini et al.
p6316
aV2007).
p6317
aVStudies of workers at higher exposure levels are required to clarify the question of genotoxicity, which is the important qualitative non-tumor end point for making human cancer risk assessments for BD (Albertini et al.
p6318
aV2003).
p6319
aVIn the present study, we analyzed a large population of BD-exposed workers and nonexposed control subjects from Yangzi Petrochemical Products Company in Nanjing, China, to determine the MF of the HPRT gene in lymphocytes.
p6320
aVWe then compared the differences in the exon deletions to help us understand the mechanisms responsible for the mutagenicity of BD.
p6321
aVThe large population study was initiated in 2002 at Yangzi Petrochemical Products Co. in Nanjing, China.
p6322
aVAll subjects worked at the alkenes plant of this company.
p6323
aVA total of 237 subjects were included in the study.
p6324
aVAmong them, 80 subjects from the BD production workshop were categorized into the BD-exposed group, of which 74 subjects (92.5%) finished the evaluations.
p6325
aVFor comparision, 157 subjects from the administrative office and the vapor workshop of the same plant were enrolled as members of the control group, and all the control subjects (100%) finished the evaluations.
p6326
aVThe subjects in the BD-exposed group and the control group were matched for age and sex.
p6327
aVQuestionnaires and blood samples for all subjects were accompanied by regular physical examinations once every 2 years at the Yangzi Employee Hospital.
p6328
aVAn informed consent document was signed by each subject after the procedures and the purpose of the study were explained.
p6329
aVAll subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire to gather information on sex; age; employment history; chemical exposure; history of the use of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine-containing beverages; recent illnesses; general health; and medications, etc.
p6330
aVA 15-mL blood sample was collected from each subject in the Yangzi Employee Hospital.
p6331
aVBlood samples were stored at room temperature in an insulated container and were delivered to the laboratory within 12 hr of collection.
p6332
aVBecause of the production process for BD and the activities of workers during the work shift, 10 locations in the BD production workshop were chosen for air sampling, including the areas for procedure control, the analytical laboratory, product storage, and the pipeline.
p6333
aVThe individuals in the BD-exposed group worked 8 hr/day, 4 days/week.
p6334
aVExcept for regular sampling (once every 4 hr) and circuit inspection (once per hour), the workers in the BD production workshop stayed in the procedure control center or the analytical laboratory while they were on duty.
p6335
aVAccording to the typical workers\u2019 routines, it was estimated that the duration of time spent in the product storage and pipeline areas was no more than 1 hr/day, or 300 hr/year, for each worker.
p6336
aVFor comparison with the production locations, two locations\u2014one in the administrative office and one in the vapor workshop of the same plant\u2014were chosen for air sampling in the control group.
p6337
aVFor each sampling location, an air sampler (Gillian Instrument Corp., Wayne, NJ, USA) collected air samples once a day for 3 consecutive days.
p6338
aVThe air was drawn through charcoal tubes using a sampling pump, and a total of 4 L of air were collected at a flow rate of 0.2 L/min for each sample.
p6339
aVAfter sampling, each charcoal tube collected was desorbed in dichloromethane alkyl, and the samples were analyzed quantitatively for BD using a gas chromatograph fitted with a flame inozation detector (Beijing Analytical Instrument Factory, Beijing, China) according to the standard operation procedure.
p6340
aVWe selected the T-cell cloning assay as the HPRT mutation assay for our study; the method has been described previously (Ma et al.
p6341
aV2000).
p6342
aVBriefly, Ficoll reagent (Haoyang Biological Manufacture Co., Tianjin, China) was used to isolate the peripheral lymphocytes from whole blood by density centrifugation.
p6343
aVThe isolated lymphocytes were stimulated for 48 hr in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 \u03bcg/mL purified phytohemagglutinin (PHA-M; Gibco/BRL Life Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD, USA), 20% HL-1 medium (Bio-Whittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD, USA), and 10% bovine calf serum (BCS; Gibco/BRL Life Technologies Inc.).
p6344
aVThe lymphocytes were then counted and seeded at 1 × 104 viable cells per well in round-bottomed 96-well micro-well plates with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with reduced PHA-M (1 \u03bcg/mL), 10% human T-stim (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA, USA), 20% HL-1 medium, and 15% BCS.
p6345
aVThe cells were cultured together with an equal number of irradiated lymphoblastoid feeder cells (irradiation was 50 Gy Cobalt-60).
p6346
aVTo determine the cloning efficiency (CE), lymphocytes were plated at densities of one and two cells per well in the absence of 6-thioguanine (6-TG).
p6347
aVTo determine the MF, the remaining cells were plated at 1 × 104 viable cells per well in the presence of 6-TG (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).
p6348
aVAll the plates were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 10\u201314 days to determine CE, or to select the HPRT mutant clones and determine MF.
p6349
aVCE was calculated using Poisson distribution analysis: CE = \u2212ln P0/N, where P0 was the fraction of wells negative for colony growth and N was the average number of cells originally inoculated per well by limiting dilution.
p6350
aVThe thioguanine-selected CE divided by the mean unselected CE yields the MF.
p6351
aVMutant lymphocyte clones were identified with an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
p6352
aVAll the mutant clones were selected for expansion, and the culture medium for expansion was the same as that for the initial culture in 96-well plates.
p6353
aVMutant clones were expanded first from one well of 96-well plates to 24-well plates, then to 6- or 12-well culture plates.
p6354
aVOnly the clones that expanded successfully to \u2265 1 × 106 cells were collected for DNA isolation, and the aliquots were frozen for further molecular analysis.
p6355
aVAll wells of an expanded mutant clone were pooled and harvested for the isolation of DNA.
p6356
aVA wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) was used to isolate DNA from cells; the isolation was performed according to the procedure of Ma et al.
p6357
aV(2000).
p6358
aVSimultaneously, normal lymphocytes were collected to isolate DNA to serve as controls for the further molecular analysis.
p6359
aVExon loss and changes in the size of each exon were identified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly, and these changes were defined as exon deletions of the HPRT gene.
p6360
aVIf the number of exon deletions were \u2265 2 (2\u20139 exons), they were considered large deletions.
p6361
aVAll expanded HPRT mutant clones were analyzed by a multiplex PCR assay to detect exon deletions.
p6362
aVMultiplex PCR amplification of the HPRT gene was performed as previously described (Liu et al.
p6363
aV2003), with slight modifications.
p6364
aVNine HPRT exons were amplified simultaneously using eight pairs of PCR primers; exons 7 and 8 were amplified as a single PCR product.
p6365
aVFor amplification of HPRT exons, the genomic DNA template (36\u201350 ng) was mixed with 50 pmol of each primer pair in a total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcL, containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.8), 0.3\u20131.05 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 2.5 U of Amplitaq DNA polymerase (Shenggong Chemical Co., Shanghai, China).
p6366
aVAfter initial denaturation of the template DNA at 98°C for 7 min, a total of 40 PCR cycles were performed with denaturation at 94°C for 1.5 min, annealing at 52°C for 1.5 min and extension at 72°C for 2.0 min.
p6367
aVExon 1 was synthesized individually with modified conditions: a total of 30 PCR cycles were performed with denaturation at 95°C for 0.5 min, annealing at 64°C for 1.0 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min.
p6368
aVThe last cycle was finished with a 7-min extension at 72°C.
p6369
aVThe PCR product (10 \u03bcL) was analyzed by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis or 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
p6370
aVThe differences in the HPRT mutant frequency and cloning efficiency between the two study groups were analyzed by the Student t-test.
p6371
aVThese statistical evaluations were performed with SPSS 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
p6372
aVIn the present study the minimum exposure to BD that could be measured with our equipment was 0.2 ppm.
p6373
aVAll 30 samples evaluated at the 10 locations of the BD-exposed group ranged from to 83.1 ppm; among them, four samples could not be measured, which meant their values were &lt; 0.2 ppm (Figure 1; Table 1).
p6374
aVThe sample with the highest concentration of BD (83.1 ppm) was collected from the sewer exit in the workshop and was only observed once.
p6375
aVWhen all data from three samplings were considered, the average BD exposure was 9.7 ± 15.7 ppm.
p6376
aVIf the highest value was ignored, the other 29 samples ranged from to 25.8 ppm, and the average value was 7.2 ± 7.6 ppm in the exposed areas.
p6377
aVAll samples evaluated at the control group locations were below the minimum exposure that could be measured (&lt; 0.2 ppm).
p6378
aVThe data of BD exposure in this study were consistent with the historical records from 1991 to 2001 in this workshop.
p6379
aVOn the basis of the information collected using the questionnaire, BD-exposed workers (n = 74) and control subjects (n = 157) had similar demographic characteristics (Table 2), including sex, age, and duration of employment.
p6380
aVThe mean age for BD-exposed workers and control subjects was 30.7 and 34.8 years of age, respectively.
p6381
aVNone of the female subjects in either group smoked, but the proportions of male smokers were 36.5% in the BD-exposed group and 33.8% in the control group, respectively.
p6382
aVThere were no significant differences found in smoking, consumption of alcohol, or consumption of caffeine-containing beverages between BD-exposed workers and control subjects.
p6383
aVThe lymphocyte cloning efficiencies and the frequencies of mutants of the study population are listed in Table 3.
p6384
aVThere was a non-significant difference in CE between the BD-exposed workers and control subjects.
p6385
aVThe MF of BD-exposed workers was 18.2 ± 9.4 (×10\u22126), which was higher than the 12.7 ± 7.3 (×10\u22126) for the control subjects, but this difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.05).
p6386
aVThe mean numbers of mutants per subject were 8 in the BD-exposed group and 6 in the control group.
p6387
aVWe analyzed a total of 783 HPRT mutants by multiplex PCR, including 368 mutants from BD-exposed workers and 415 mutants from control subjects.
p6388
aVResults of the exon deletions detected by multiplex PCR are summarized in Table 4.
p6389
aVA schematic of the distribution of deleted exons in mutants is presented in Figure 2, which shows that 630 mutant clones amplified all nine exons after multiplex PCR analysis, indicating these clones with wild-type multiplex PCR patterns had potential point mutations.
p6390
aVThe frequency of exon deletions in BD-exposed workers was 27.4% (101/368), which was significantly higher than the 12.5% (52/415) in control subjects (p &lt; 0.05).
p6391
aVThe types of deletion mutants can be divided into single exon deletions, multiple exon deletions (2\u20138 exon deletions), and mutants in which all nine exons had deletions.
p6392
aVThe increase in exon deletions in the BD-exposed group appears to be mainly the result of an increase in the proportion of multiple exon deletions (56/368, 15.2%) compared with the control group (23/415, 5.5%; p &lt; 0.05).
p6393
aVThe multiple exon deletions can be further divided into continuous and discontinuous deletions, both of which had significant differences between the BD-exposed group and the control group (p &lt; 0.05).
p6394
aVIn addition, results of PCR analysis showed that some of the mutants from the same subject had different mutational spectra (data not shown).
p6395
aVIn 1996 Hayes et al.
p6396
aV(1996) first reported the HPRT gene MF among workers exposed to BD in China.
p6397
aVThat study was conducted at Yanshan Petrochemical Products Co., one of the biggest petrochemical products corporations in China located in Beijing in the northern part of China.
p6398
aVThe present study was performed at the Yangzi Petrochemical Products Co., another large petrochemical products corporation located in Nanjing in the eastern part of China.
p6399
aVIt should be noted that the solvent for producing BD is different between these two plants\u2014acrylonitrile (ACN) in Yanshan Petrochemical Products Co. and dimethylformamide (DMF) in Yangzi Petrochemical Products Co.
p6400
aVIn addition, the BD production equipment in the present study was imported from Japan and has been used to produce BD since 1987.
p6401
aVAccording to records kept by the facility that documented BD air concentrations, the exposure levels detected in 1991 in this workshop ranged from to 4.4 ppm.
p6402
aVIn 1996 there were 9 samples that ranged from 3.1 to 24.9 ppm among the 27 total samples collected from 9 locations of the same workshop.
p6403
aVThe other 18 samples had BD levels below the limit of detection (LOD; the minimum exposure dose that could be measured depended on the analytical method.
p6404
aVIn China the LOD was about 0.4 ppm when sampling with syringe, but 0.2 ppm when sampling with charcoal tube).
p6405
aVIn 1998 another study of BD exposure was carried out in the same workshop.
p6406
aVIn this study there were a total of 60 samples collected from 20 locations with exposure levels ranging from to 6.0 ppm.
p6407
aVIn the present study, when data from all three samplings were considered, the average value of BD detected was 9.7 ppm.
p6408
aVIf we excluded the highest value from the sewer exit location in the workshop, the other 29 samples ranged from to 25.8 ppm, and the average value of BD was 7.2 ppm (Table 1).
p6409
aVThese BD exposure data are consistent with the historical records for the same workshop recorded from 1991 to 2001 described above.
p6410
aVComparing this BD exposure data with other studies, our data indicate that the BD level is higher than that detected in the Yanshan Petrochemical Products Co. (Hayes et al.
p6411
aV1996),
p6412
aVin which air levels of BD ranged from 1\u201345 ppm, and the median level was 2.0 ppm during routine activities.
p6413
aVHowever, our data showed much higher BD levels than those detected in other BD-producing plants, one in Texas, the other near Prague in the Czech Republic.
p6414
aVIn the Texas plant the BD exposure levels found for workers in the first study were 3.5 ± 7.5 ppm in the high-exposure areas (Ward et al.
p6415
aV1994).
p6416
aVWith the improvements made in the plant to reduce the BD exposure, the average exposure decreased to 1.65 ± 0.52 ppm in the high-exposure areas and to 0.07 ± 0.03 ppm in the low-exposure areas, with a median exposure level of 0.41 ppm (Ward et al.
p6417
aV2001).
p6418
aVIn the plant near Prague the mean exposure level was 1.76 ppm, and the individual exposure levels ranged from 0.012 to 19.77 ppm (Tates et al.
p6419
aV1996).
p6420
aVOverall, exposure levels varied widely among plants of different countries.
p6421
aVWe presume that BD exposure levels depend primarily on the quality of the equipment used to produce BD, the level of automation present in the plant, the equipment running time, and length of time the operators worked in the plant.
p6422
aVOur data showed that the alkenes plant of the Yangzi Petrochemical Products Co. in China has one of the highest BD exposure levels among several reported BD production plants.
p6423
aVAlthough BD had been identified as a rodent carcinogen, the evidence supporting a correlation between BD exposure and HPRT MF in humans was inconsistent.
p6424
aVIn this study we found an increase in HPRT gene MFs between the BD-exposed workers (18.2 ± 9.4 × 10\u22126) and the control subjects (12.7 ± 7.3 × 10\u22126) by using the T-cell cloning assay.
p6425
aVThis 43.17% difference was, however, not statistically significant.
p6426
aVOur results were consistent with those of previous studies in BD-exposed Chinese workers under lower exposure levels of BD using the same cloning assay (Hayes et al.
p6427
aV1996; Zhang et al.
p6428
aV2004).
p6429
aVAfter adjustment by multiple regression analysis for age, sex, and cloning efficiency, Hayes et al.
p6430
aV(1996) found that the adjusted mean MF was 13.6 × 10\u22126 in nonexposed workers and 18.0 × 10\u22126 in BD-exposed workers, which was also not significantly different.
p6431
aVOther groups using the T-cell cloning assay to study BD-exposed workers in the Czech Republic also failed to find an increase in HPRT MF, even though the level of BD exposure was similar to that used in the studies in the Texas plant (Albertini et al.
p6432
aV2001; Tates et al.
p6433
aV1996).
p6434
aVAll these studies are in contrast to the other studies using autoradiographic assays, which found a correlation between BD exposure and HPRT gene mutation (Ammenheuser et al.
p6435
aV2001; Ward et al.
p6436
aV1994, 1996, 2001).
p6437
aVWard et al.
p6438
aV(1994) reported the MF increased significantly in these BD-exposed workers compared with control subjects who worked in nonindustrial settings.
p6439
aVIn a subsequent study (Ward et al.
p6440
aV2001), it was demonstrated that the MF in lymphocytes was significantly higher in the high-exposure group (10.67 ± 1.5 × 10\u22126) compared with the low-exposure group (3.54 ± 0.6 × 10\u22126; p &lt; 0.001), even though improvements were made in the plant to reduce BD exposure.
p6441
aVThese results indicated that the positive findings had been observed repetitively in the series studies in Texas.
p6442
aVIt also suggested the differences between mutation assays may be one of the reasons that resulted in the difference in the effects of BD exposure.
p6443
aVThus, because there were contradictory results from different plants in different countries, it was unclear whether BD induced an increase in MF.
p6444
aVIn 2001 Ward et al.
p6445
aV(2001) reported they had conducted autoradiograghic assays on cryopreserved lymphocytes from subjects in the Czech Republic concurrently with their study of workers in Texas and found a very high MF of the HPRT gene in the Czech administrative workers who had volunteered to serve as nonsmoking controls for the study in Prague.
p6446
aVIt was proposed that the high MF in the nonsmoking controls was due, in part, to very high MFs in a few subjects, some of whom appeared to have had health problems or exposure to mutagens other than BD.
p6447
aVThis indicates that the selection of control subjects is an important factor that may determine whether there is any significant difference in MF of the HPRT gene between exposed and nonexposed subjects.
p6448
aVIt is therefore imperative that more detailed information be considered when exposure data are collected and how it is associated with the individual subjects, including how much of the variation in MF is attributable to each variable (e.g., smoking status, health history, exposure history).
p6449
aVIn the present study, we evaluated data from BD-exposed and control subjects matched for age, sex, work duration, consumption of alcohol and caffeine-containing beverages, and smoking and found no significant differences between the groups.
p6450
aVHowever, it is possible that if we had been able to stratify the BD-exposed and nonexposed populations according to the extent of exposure (some combination of measured exposure and years of work, plus years of smoking, for example), we could have observed if there was any effect that may have been lost in the pooled data.
p6451
aVOther authors have paid more attention to these questions.
p6452
aVIn one study Ward et al.
p6453
aV(2001) divided the BD-exposed subjects into subgroups according to smoking status and found that the MF of the HPRT gene was significantly higher in the high-exposure nonsmokers (8.64 ± 1.6 × 10\u22126) than in the low-exposure nonsmokers (3.46 ± 0.65 × 10\u22126).
p6454
aVHowever, the highest MF of HPRT (13.10 ± 2.57 × 10\u22126) was observed in the high-exposure smokers.
p6455
aVTheir findings were consistent with those of Podlutsky et al.
p6456
aV(1999), who found a statistically significant increase in the MF of the HPRT gene between the smoking group (26.6 ± 18.5 × 10\u22126) and the nonsmoking group (18.7 ± 12.0 × 10\u22126).
p6457
aVThese studies indicate that the MF observed in BD-exposed and nonexposed subjects is also dependent upon other factors such as diet, lifestyle, general health status, and exposure to other genotoxic substances in the ambient environment.
p6458
aVThese factors should be explored in future studies.
p6459
aVDespite the evidence indicating that BD has mutagenic effects, the molecular mechanism of its mutagenesis is not understood.
p6460
aVThe mutagenicity of major BD metabolites has been well documented in many in vitro studies, and analysis of the mutational spectra in these studies indicates that there is a distinct difference between EB- and DEB-induced mutations in the HPRT gene.
p6461
aVThe genotoxic potencies of BD metabolites are of the order: DEB &gt;&gt; EB &gt;&gt; EB-diol.
p6462
aVHowever, there is controversy about which metabolites are important for human carcinogenicity.
p6463
aVAlthough DEB is the most potent mutagen, reports have suggested that it is not a significant factor in in vivo mutagenesis in humans (Bond et al.
p6464
aV1995).
p6465
aVThis is further corroborated by the presence of smaller quantities of DEB in rats and humans than those found in mice (Filser et al.
p6466
aV2001; Koc et al.
p6467
aV1999; Walker and Meng 2000).
p6468
aVFinally, DEB and EB differ in their metabolism, mechanism of DNA interaction, and mutagenic potential.
p6469
aVIn our study, we observed a statistically significant increase in the total number of HPRT clones with deletions in the BD-exposed workers compared with the control subjects (p &lt; 0.05).
p6470
aVThe increase appeared to be primarily the result of an increase in multiple exon deletions (p &lt; 0.05), including both continuous deletions and discontinuous deletions (Table 4).
p6471
aVOur results are in agreement with the data from Ma et al.
p6472
aV(2000), Burkhart-Schultz and Jones (1997), and Burkhart-Schultz et al.
p6473
aV(1996).
p6474
aVAnalysis of the in vitro mutational spectra of DEB- and EB-induced mutants in a study by Steen et al.
p6475
aV(1997a, 1997b) clearly revealed that a decrease in the proportion of single-base substitutions was associated with an increase in the proportion of large deletion mutations
p6476
aVOur data and similar findings by Meng et al.
p6477
aV(2004) indicate that it is not necessary to invoke the formation of DEB as the sole source of large exon deletions; rather, HPRT spectra data from rats indicate that EB-diol is a likely source of deletion mutations.
p6478
aVIn summary the results of the exposure assessment study indicate the BD occupational exposure of workers in China is relatively high, when the data are compared with those from studies conducted of other countries.
p6479
aVThus, we suppose that the increases of exon deletions in the mutants from exposed workers likely represent the mutations induced by BD.
p6480
aVIn a previous study Ma et al.
p6481
aV(2000) further used HPRT coding sequence analysis and compared the molecular mutational spectrum of BD-exposed workers with those of control subjects.
p6482
aVThe authors identified a lower frequency of single-base substitutions, a higher proportion of A:T \u2192 T:A transversions and ± 1 frameshift mutations in BD-exposed workers.
p6483
aVThese changes were also confirmed by Meng et al.
p6484
aV(2004) in mice and rats.
p6485
aVLong-term exposure of arsenite leads to human skin cancer.
p6486
aVHowever, the exact mechanisms of arsenite-induced human skin carcinogenesis remain to be defined.
p6487
aVIn this study, we investigated the potential role of PI-3K/Akt/cyclin D1in the transformation of human keratinocytic cells upon arsenite exposure.
p6488
aVWe used the soft agar assay to evaluate the cell transformation activity of arsenite exposure and the nude mice xenograft model to determine the tumorigenesis of arsenite-induced transformed cells.
p6489
aVWe used the dominant negative mutant and gene knockdown approaches to elucidate the signaling pathway involved in this process.
p6490
aVOur results showed that repeated long-term exposure of HaCat cells to arsenite caused cell transformation, as indicated by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar.
p6491
aVThe tumorigenicity of these transformed cells was confirmed in nude mice.
p6492
aVTreatment of cells with arsenite also induced significant activation of PI-3K and Akt, which was responsible for the anchorage-independent cell growth induced by arsenite exposure.
p6493
aVFurthermore, our data also indicated that cyclin D1 is an important downstream molecule involved in PI-3K/Akt\u2013mediated cell transformation upon arsenite exposure based on the facts that inhibition of cyclin D1 expression by dominant negative mutants of PI-3K, and Akt, or the knockdown of the cyclin D1 expression by its specific siRNA in the HaCat cells resulted in impairing of anchorage-independent growth of HaCat cells induced by arsenite.
p6494
aVOur results demonstrate that PI-3K/Akt\u2013mediated cyclin D1 expression is at least one key event implicated in the arsenite human skin carcinogenic effect.
p6495
aVArsenite is a well-documented human carcinogen.
p6496
aVLong-term exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water has been reported to induce various cancers (Centeno et al.
p6497
aV2002; Huang et al.
p6498
aV2004; Tseng et al.
p6499
aV1968; Yu et al.
p6500
aV2006).
p6501
aVChronic exposure to arsenite can lead to its accumulation in the skin and cause skin hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis (Centeno et al.
p6502
aV2002; Yu et al.
p6503
aV2006).
p6504
aVThis could in turn develop into skin cancers, including Bowen disease (carcinoma in situ), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Tseng et al.
p6505
aV1968; Yu et al.
p6506
aV2006).
p6507
aVCancer development results from a synergism between genotoxic and nongenotoxic factors (Hecker 1987; Zoumpourlis et al.
p6508
aV2003).
p6509
aVThe former induces irreversible genetic alterations (tumor initiation), whereas the latter promotes tumor development by favoring the clone outgrowth of the genetically altered cells (tumor promotion) through activating cell survival and proliferation signal pathways and altering the machineries controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis.
p6510
aVPrevious studies have demonstrated that arsenite has a weak mutagen effect; therefore it is thought that its ability to activate signaling pathways leading to the alteration of gene expression responsible for cell growth may play an important role in its carcinogenic effect (Bernstam and Nriagu 2000).
p6511
aVIt has been demonstrated that signal pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), activating factor 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), can be activated upon arsenite exposure and presumably contribute to arsenite-induced skin carcinogenic effect (Cooper et al.
p6512
aV2004; Huang et al.
p6513
aV2001, 2004).
p6514
aVPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) comprises an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and could be activated by multiple growth factors and cytokines (Cantley 2002; Vivanco and Sawyers 2002).
p6515
aVUpon activation, PI-3K generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger essential for the activation of protein kinase B (Akt) (Alessi et al.
p6516
aV1997; Toker and Cantley 1997).
p6517
aVAkt in turn regulates various cellular functions such as apoptosis and proliferation (Alessi et al.
p6518
aV1997; Franke et al.
p6519
aV2003).
p6520
aVPI-3K/Akt has been demonstrated to be an important signaling pathway for cell survival and growth, and it also plays a pivotal role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis (Huang et al.
p6521
aV1999; Li et al.
p6522
aV2005; Nicholson and Anderson 2002; Ouyang et al.
p6523
aV2005a; Samuels and Ericson 2006).
p6524
aVThe elevated expression or high phosphorylation of Akt could be observed in many tumor cells (Asanuma et al.
p6525
aV2005; Bae et al.
p6526
aV2006; Misra et al.
p6527
aV2006).
p6528
aVMost recently, He et al.
p6529
aV(2006) reported that PI-3K/Akt is related to the malignant transformation associated with acquired apoptotic resistance in human HaCaT keratinocytes induced by chronic UVA irradiation.
p6530
aVSouza et al.
p6531
aV(2001) have reported that PI-3K is required for the induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS) by arsenite in human keratinocytes.
p6532
aVOur previous studies have also shown that arsenite exposure is able to activate the PI-3K/Akt pathway and induce cyclin D1 expression in mouse epidermal Cl41 cells (Ouyang et al.
p6533
aV2006).
p6534
aVIn HaCat cells, the PI-3K/Akt/cyclin D1 cascade activation contributed to arsenite-induced proliferation (Ouyang et al.
p6535
aV2007b).
p6536
aVAlthough hyperproliferation is correlated with cellular transformation in some cases (Chen et al.
p6537
aV2001), our previous findings clearly demonstrated that in Cl41 cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced transformation was impaired by disrupting PI3K/p85 expression; however, cell proliferation was not affected (Huang et al.
p6538
aV1996), which indicates that the transformation ability is not always paralleled with the accelerated proliferation rate.
p6539
aVTherefore, we performed the present studies to investigate whether the PI-3K/Akt signal pathway is indeed implicated in arsenite-induced cell transformation through the induction of cyclin D1.
p6540
aVSpontaneously immortalized human keratinocytes, HaCat cell line, and their stable transfectants were cultured in monolayers at 37°C, 5% CO2 using Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, and 25 \u03bcg gentamicin/mL.
p6541
aVNormal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were cultured in keratinocyte\u2013SFM medium (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing supplements (human epidermal growth factor, bovine pituitary extract; Invitrogen) and gentamycin (5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA).
p6542
aVThe cultures were detached with trypsin and transferred to new 75-cm2 culture flasks (Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) twice a week.
p6543
aVFBS was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; DMEM was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); sodium arsenite was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA).
p6544
aVThe dominant-negative mutants of Akt (DN-Akt) and PI-3K (\u0394p85) were described in our previous studies (Huang et al.

aVThe specific small interference RNA (siRNA)\u2013targeted human cyclin D1 was described before (Ouyang et al.
p6549
aV2005b).
p6550
aVThe target sequence was inserted into the pSuppressor vector and verified by DNA sequencing.
p6551
aVWe transfected HaCat cells with DN-Akt and \u0394p85 or vector control plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen Corp.) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.
p6552
aVBriefly, HaCat cells were cultured in a 6-well plate to 85\u201390% confluence.
p6553
aVFive micrograms plasmid DNA, alone or in combination with pCMV-neo vector, were for co-transfection.
p6554
aVDNA was mixed with 10 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and used to transfect each well in the absence of serum.
p6555
aVAfter 6\u20138 hr, the medium was replaced with 10% FBS DMEM.
p6556
aVApproximately 30\u201336 hr after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were detached with 0.033% trypsin, and cell suspensions were plated into 75-mL culture flasks and cultured for 24\u201328 days with G418 selection (800 \u03bcg/mL).
p6557
aVStable transfectants were established and cultured in G418-free DMEM for at least two passages before each experiment.
p6558
aVHaCat cells were stably transfected with siCyclin D1 as established and identified in our published studies (Ouyang et al.
p6559
aV2005b).
p6560
aVWe conducted the PI-3 kinase activity assay as described in our previous reports (Huang et al.
p6561
aV1996; Ouyang et al.
p6562
aV2006).
p6563
aVBriefly, cells were cultured in monolayers in 100-mm dishes using normal culture medium.
p6564
aVThe medium was replaced with 0.1% FBS DMEM containing 2 mM l-glutamine and 25 \u03bcg gentamicin/mL after the cell density reached 70\u201380%.
p6565
aVForty-five hours later, we incubated the cells with fresh serum-free DMEM for 3\u20134 hr at 37°C.
p6566
aVArsenite was then added to the cell cultures for PI-3K induction.
p6567
aVThe cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 400 \u03bcL lysis buffer/plate [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1-mM DTT, 0.4 mM sodium ortho-vanadate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride].
p6568
aVThe lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were incubated at 4°C with 40 \u03bcL agarose beads (conjugated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody Py20) overnight.
p6569
aVBeads were washed twice with each of the following buffers: a) PBS with 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT; b) 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 M LiCl, l mM DTT; and c) 10 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT.
p6570
aVBeads were incubated for 5 min on ice in 20 \u03bcL buffer 3, then 20 \u03bcL of 0.5 mg/mL phosphatidylinositol [sonicated previously in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM NaH2PO4] were added.
p6571
aVAfter 5 min at room temperature, 10 \u03bcL of the reaction buffer were added [50 mM MgCl2, 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 250 \u03bcM ATP containing 5 \u03bcCi \u03b3-32P- ATP], and the beads were incubated for an additional 15 min.
p6572
aVThe reactions were stopped by the addition of 15 \u03bcL of 4 N HCl and 130 \u03bcL chloroform/methanol (1:1).
p6573
aVAfter vortexing for 30 sec, the solutions, 30 \u03bcL from the phospholipid-containing chloroform phase were spotted onto thin-layer chromagraphy plates coated with silica gel H containing 1.3% potassium oxalate and 2 mM EDTA applied in H2O/methanol (3:2).
p6574
aVThe plates were heated at 110°C for at least 3 hr before use.
p6575
aVThe plates were then placed in tanks containing chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/H2O (600:470:20:113) for 40\u201350 min until the solvent reached the top of the plates.
p6576
aVThe plates were dried at room temperature and autoradiographed.
p6577
aVWe cultured HaCat cells and their transfectants (2 × 105) in each well of 6-well plates to 70\u201380% confluence with normal culture medium.
p6578
aVThe cell culture medium was replaced with 0.1% FBS DMEM with 2 mM l-glutamine and 25 \u03bcg gentamicin and cultured for 43 hr.
p6579
aVThe cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 3\u20134 hr at 37°C.
p6580
aVAfter exposure to arsenite, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, then extracted with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample buffer.
p6581
aVThe cell extracts were separated on polyacrylamide\u2013SDS gels, transferred, and probed with each of the antibodies against phosphor-specific Akt (Thr308), phosphor-specific Akt (Ser473), Akt, cyclin D1, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
p6582
aVThe protein bands specifically bound to the primary antibodies were detected using an anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody and an ECF (enhanced chemifluorescence) Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) (Ouyang et al.
p6583
aV2006).
p6584
aVConfluent monolayers of HaCat cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 103 of viable cells suspended in 100 \u03bcL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were added to each well of 96-well plates.
p6585
aVThe plates were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
p6586
aVTwelve hours later, we exposed the cells to arsenite for 5 days at the concentrations indicated.
p6587
aVThe exposed cells were lysed with 50 \u03bcL lysis buffer, and the proliferation of the cells was measured using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with a luminometer (Wallac 1420 Victor2 multipliable counter system; Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
p6588
aVThe results are expressed as luciferase activity relative to control medium (proliferation index).
p6589
aVWe cultured HaCat cells and their transfectants (1 × 105) in each well of 6-well plates to 50\u201360% confluence with normal culture medium.
p6590
aVThe cells were treated with 2.5 \u03bcM arsenite for 3 days, then recovered in fresh medium for 1 day.
p6591
aVAfter the repeated treatment with arsenite for 8 weeks, the cells were used for anchorage-independent growth assay, which was performed as described previously (Huang et al.
p6592
aV1999; Yan et al.
p6593
aV2006).
p6594
aVBriefly, 2.5 mL of 0.5% agar in basal modified Eagle\u2019s medium (BMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS was laid onto each well of 6-well tissue culture plates.
p6595
aVWe mixed 2 × 104 HaCat cells with 2 mL of 0.5% agar BMEM and layered the cells on top of the 0.5% agar layer.
p6596
aVThe plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 weeks.
p6597
aVWe then scored the colonies with more than 16 cells.
p6598
aVWe randomly divided six 5-week-old female nude mice into two experimental groups\u2014medium control group and arsenite-treated group.
p6599
aVEach nude mouse was injected sc in two spots with 2 × 106 of cells in 100 \u03bcL of growth medium for each spot.
p6600
aVThe mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation 4 weeks after the inoculation, tumor dimensions were measured using calipers and tumor volume (cubic millimeters) was calculated using the following formula: 0.5236 (L × W × H) as described in previous studies (Brubaker et al.
p6601
aV2006; Jungwirth et al.

aVTumors were removed from mice, and fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin; 5-\u03bcm sections were dehydrated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E).
p6605
aVThe significant difference between the treated and untreated groups was determined with the Student t-test.
p6606
aVResults are expressed as mean ± SD.
p6607
aVHuman skin is a major target of environmental carcinogen arsenite.
p6608
aVTo elucidate the mechanism implicated in arsenite-induced human skin carcinogenic effect in vitro, we first evaluated the cytotoxicity of arsenite to HaCat cells with CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit.
p6609
aVWe found that exposure of HaCat cell to 0.625 \u03bcM arsenite caused a significant increase in cell proliferation (Figure 1A) and no inhibition of cell proliferation at doses lower than 2.5 \u03bcM arsenite (Figure 1A).
p6610
aVThus, we used 2.5 \u03bcM arsenite to treat human keratinocyte HaCat cells to establish a cell transformation model.
p6611
aVHaCat cells were exposed repeatedly to 2.5 \u03bcM arsenite twice a week for 8 weeks, and the anchorage-independent growth capability of arsenite-treated HaCat cells was evaluated.
p6612
aVCompared with the medium control, repeated arsenite exposure resulted in increased the anchorage-independent growth capacity of HaCat cells (Figure 1B, C).
p6613
aVThose results indicate that arsenite-exposed HaCat cells obtain the ability of anchorage-independent growth for colony formation in soft agar.
p6614
aVThe tumor characteristic of the transformed cells was further confirmed in nude mice.
p6615
aVAs shown in Figure 1D, injection of arsenite long-term exposed Hacat cells into nude mouse caused observable tumor formation (tumor volumes 786 ± 126, n = 6) compared with that of long-term culture HaCat cells (0 ± 0, n = 6).
p6616
aVH&amp;E staining also revealed a tumor formation in the arsenite long-term exposed Hacat cells (Figure 1E).
p6617
aVOn the basis of these results, we anticipate that repeated exposure of HaCat cells to arsenite could cause malignant transformation.
p6618
aVOur previous studies have shown that PI-3K is essential for Cl41 cells obtaining anchorage-independent growth capacity in TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and EGF treatments (Huang et al.
p6619
aV1999; Ouyang et al.
p6620
aV2005b).
p6621
aVIn addition, our published studies have shown that arsenite exposure is able to activate PI-3K in mouse epidermal Cl41 cells (Ouyang et al.
p6622
aV2006).
p6623
aVTo determine the potential involvement of the PI-3K pathway in arsenite-induced HaCat cell transformation, we tested the PI-3K activity in arsenite-exposed HaCat cells.
p6624
aVThe results showed that the arsenite exposure did increase PI-3K activation in HaCat cells compared with the medium control (Figure 2A, B).
p6625
aVWe also further confirmed this finding in NHEKs (Figure 2C, D).
p6626
aVThe aforementioned data demonstrate that PI-3K is implicated in human keratinocyte response to arsenite exposure.
p6627
aVUpon activation, PI-3K generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger essential for the translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated and activated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) (Alessi et al.
p6628
aV1997; Toker and Cantley 1997).
p6629
aVSubsequently, Akt phosphorylates and regulates the function of many downstream cellular proteins involved in the processes of apoptosis, proliferation, and transformation (Alessi et al.
p6630
aV1997; Franke et al.
p6631
aV2003).
p6632
aVTo test possible Akt activation by arsenite in human keratinocytes, we determined Akt activation in both HaCat and NHEKs by evaluating its phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473.
p6633
aVThe results indicated that arsenite exposure was able to activate Akt in both cells (Figure 3A, B), which was consistent with PI-3K activation.
p6634
aVTo elucidate the PI-3K/Akt pathway and its role in human keratinocyte response to arsenite response, we established the stable HaCat \u0394p85 and DN-Akt transfectants.
p6635
aVEctopic expression of \u0394p85 and DN-Akt dramatically reduced arsenite-induced Akt activation (Figure 3A), and consequently blocked cell transformation upon chronic arsenite exposure in HaCat cells (Figure 3C, D).
p6636
aVThese results demonstrate the critical role of the PI-3K/Akt pathway in arsenite-induced HaCat transformation.
p6637
aVIt has been thought that the contribution of the PI-3K/Akt pathway to tumorigenesis could be associated with either its regulation of cell apoptosis or cell growth.
p6638
aVOur previous studies have shown that arsenite exposure is able to up-regulate cyclin D1 protein expression in HaCat cells, which further mediates cell cycle alternation in HaCat cells (Ouyang et al.
p6639
aV2005b).
p6640
aVThus, it is important to determine whether there is a link between arsenite-induced PI-3K/Akt activation and cyclin D1 protein expression.
p6641
aVArsenite treatment resulted in a marked increase in cyclin D1 protein expression in both HaCat cells (Figure 4A) and NHEKs (Figure 4B), and this cyclin D1 induction was dramatically impaired in \u0394p85 or DN-Akt stable transfectants (Figure 4C),
p6642
aVindicating that the PI-3K/Akt pathway is critical for cyclin D1 protein induction by arsenite.
p6643
aVIt might be noted that overexpression of DN-Akt was able to block Akt activation, whereas \u0394p85 only showed a partial inhibition of Akt activation induced upon arsenite treatment (Figure 3A).
p6644
aVThis differential inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by DN-Akt and \u0394p85 could be due to the protein expression levels of those two exogenous dominant negative mutants, or alternate pathways may be involved in the Akt activation.
p6645
aVIt might also be noted that \u0394p85 is able to block arsenite-induced cyclin D1 expression completely, whereas it shows only partial inhibition on Akt phosphorylation.
p6646
aVThe explanation for this may be that Akt is only one of p85 downstream kinases, and the other p85 downstream kinases such as protein kinase C, serum gluco-corticoid-inducible kinase, and Rac/CDC42 may also play some role in cyclin D1 protein expression in arsenite responses.
p6647
aVIn addition, cyclin D1 induction might need PI-3K activation to a certain level, so when Akt activation was relatively low, it was not able to cause cyclin D1 induction.
p6648
aVThe basal level of Akt phosphorylation in DN-Akt transfectants was higher than that of the vector control (Mock) transfectants.
p6649
aVThe explanation was that, due to the importance of Akt in normal cell function, the phosphorylation of the endogenous Akt in DN-Akt stable transfectant was elevated to overcome the biological effects caused by over-expression of exogenous DN-Akt.
p6650
aVHowever, the arsenite-induced phosphorylation will be greatly inhibited, as shown in Figure 3A.
p6651
aVTo evaluate the contribution of cyclin D1 protein expression to arsenite-induced HaCat cell transformation, we used HaCat cells stably transfected with cyclin D1 siRNA (Ouyang et al.
p6652
aV2005b).
p6653
aVAs shown in Figure 4D, introduction of cyclin D1 siRNA dramatically reduced the basal level of the cyclin D1 protein expression, whereas it did not affect the basal level of the cyclin D2 protein expression, verifying the specificity of cyclin D1 siRNA.
p6654
aVKnockdown of cyclin D1 expression by its siRNA abrogated the HaCat cell transformation induced by arsenite (Figure 4D, E).
p6655
aVCollectively, these results indicate that cyclin D1 is not only induced by arsenite exposure through the PI-3K/Akt-dependent pathway but it is also at least one of the key events responsible for arsenite-induced human keratinocyte transformation.
p6656
aVArsenite is a well-defined human carcinogen, with skin as its primary target organ (Centeno et al.
p6657
aV2002; Huang et al.
p6658
aV2004; Tseng et al.
p6659
aV1968; Yu et al.
p6660
aV2006).
p6661
aVBecause arsenite has only a weak mutagenic effect, it is thought that its ability to activate some signaling pathways and gene expression responsible for cell growth may play an important role in mediating its carcinogenetic effect (Bernstam and Nriagu 2000).
p6662
aVIn the present study, we demonstrated that repeated exposure of human keratinocytes to low doses of arsenite resulted in cell transformation with the characteristic of cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar.
p6663
aVThe dose we used to repeatedly treat cells did not cause obvious cell death.
p6664
aVOn the contrary, it promoted cell proliferation as we reported in our recent publication (Ouyang et al.
p6665
aV2007b).
p6666
aVThe treatment of cells with arsenite also caused the activation of PI-3K/Akt, which thereby plays a critical role in arsenite-induced cell transformation through induction of cyclin D1 expression.
p6667
aVAs an important signal pathway for cell survival and growth, PI-3K/Akt has been demonstrated to be associated with tumorigenesis (Nicholson and Anderson 2002; Samuels and Ericson 2006).
p6668
aVMore than 30% of various solid tumor were found recently to contain mutations in PIK3CA, the catalytic subunit of PI-3K (Samuels and Ericson 2006).
p6669
aVThe mutation in p85, a regulatory subunit of PI-3K, has also been reported in previous studies (Jimenez et al.
p6670
aV1998; Philp et al.
p6671
aV2001).
p6672
aVRecent studies also indicate that Akt is frequently constitutively activated in many types of human cancer (Nicholson and Anderson 2002).
p6673
aVAlthough the mechanisms have not yet been fully characterized, constitutive PI-3K/Akt signaling is believed to promote proliferation and increase cell survival, which is an indispensable event during the process of cancer development (Samuels and Ericson 2006).
p6674
aVCurrent studies demonstrated that arsenite exposure was able to activate PI-3K and Akt, and inhibition of either PI-3K or Akt by their dominant mutants impaired arsenite-induced cell transformation in human skin keratinocytes HaCat, suggesting that the PI-3K/Akt pathway may contribute to arsenite human skin carcinogenic effects.
p6675
aVReactive oxygen species (ROS) at low concentration may function as a signaling intermediator of cellular responses (Sullivan et al.
p6676
aV1994).
p6677
aVThe production of ROS in response to arsenite treatment has been observed in various cell lines (Duyndam et al.
p6678
aV2001; Ozaki et al.
p6679
aV2000), suggesting that arsenite may act early in the growth factor signaling pathway.
p6680
aVJung et al.
p6681
aV(2003) have clearly demonstrated that the predominant product by arsenite appeared to be hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) because the arsenite-induced increase in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence was completely abolished by pretreatment with catalase but not with heat-inactivated catalase.
p6682
aVBy eliminating H2O2 with catalase or N-acetylcysteine, they further found that H2O2 might act as an upstream molecule of PI-3K as well as ERK1/2 (Jung et al.
p6683
aV2003).
p6684
aVSo we propose that the generation of ROS by arsenite may be associated with various cellular processes, such as PI-3K/Akt pathway activation.
p6685
aVCyclin D1 could be induced by growth factors and stress, then regulate cell cycle and proliferation (Cook et al.
p6686
aV2000; Perry et al.
p6687
aV1998; Winston and Pledger 1993).
p6688
aVAberrant cyclin D1 expression has been observed early in carcinogenesis (Barnes and Gillett 1998; Fusenig and Boukamp 1998; Weinstein 2000), and overexpression of cyclin D1 was reported in several human cancers, including uterine cervix (Nichols et al.
p6689
aV1996), ovary (Worsley et al.
p6690
aV1997), breast (Michalides et al.
p6691
aV1996), urinary bladder (Proctor et al.
p6692
aV1991), endometrium (Semczuk and Jakowicki 2004), and skin (Rodriguez-Puebla et al.
p6693
aV1999).
p6694
aVAntisense to cyclin D1 was reported to inhibit the growth and the tumorigenicity of human colon cancer cells and induce apoptosis in human squamous carcinomas (Arber et al.
p6695
aV1997; Sauter et al.
p6696
aV1999).
p6697
aVIt has been demonstrated that carcinogenic compounds can induce cyclin D1 expression, which in turn promote tumor cell proliferation (Rodriguez-Puebla et al.
p6698
aV1999; Shen et al.
p6699
aV2006).
p6700
aVOur previous studies showed that arsenite could activate the PI-3K/Akt pathway and induce cyclin D1 expression in mouse epidermal cells.
p6701
aVIn this study, we provided the first direct evidence that cyclin D1 is a downstream target of the PI-3K/Akt signal cascade and involved in the cell transformation caused by arsenite exposure in human keratinocytes.
p6702
aVAlthough knockdown of cyclin D1 expression by its siRNA markedly inhibited cell transformation of human keratinocytes exposed to arsenite, its effect was less than expression of the dominant negative mutants of PI-3K or Akt (Figure 3D, F).
p6703
aVIt was likely that some other downstream molecules might also be the PI-3K/Akt downstream targets partially responsible for arsenite-induced cell transformation.
p6704
aVFor example, in addition to cyclin D1 induction, the PI-3K/Akt pathway has also been reported to mediate the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 and its downstream target gene vascular endothelial growth factor expression (Gao et al.
p6705
aV2004), which has been reported to promote cell transformation, induce the anti-apoptosis genes expression, and subsequently render the cell apoptosis resistance, and promote cell immigration and invasion (Larcher et al.
p6706
aV1998).
p6707
aVIn summary, our studies demonstrate that the PI-3K/Akt pathway plays a role in the arsenite-induced transformation of human keratinocytes through the induction of cyclin D1.
p6708
aVThese results provide novel information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effect of arsenite on its major target tissue of human skin, which also suggests that the PI-3K/Akt/cyclin D1 pathway might be a target for chemo-prevention of arsenite-induced skin cancer.
p6709
aVMycotoxins that commonly contaminate staple food grains pose a health hazard to animals and humans.
p6710
aVFumonisin B1 (FB1), a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium verticillioides, causes equine leukoencephalomalacia and porcine pulmonary edema and has been implicated in the etiology of esophageal cancer (EC) in the Transkei, South Africa.
p6711
aVVarious studies have indicated that nitrosamines induce EC, and F. verticillioides enhancement of nitrosamine-induced EC in rats has been reported.
p6712
aVDietary catechol (CAT), a constituent of cigarette smoke, was previously found to be a cocarcinogen with methyl-N-nitrosamine for inducing esophageal tumors in rats.
p6713
aVIn the present study we therefore investigated the cytotoxic effects of FB1, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and CAT on a human esophageal epithelial cell line (SNO) using the methylthiazol tetrazolium assay.
p6714
aVFor each treatment, toxin concentrations ranged from 2.165 to 34.64 µM.
p6715
aVThe results showed that the cytotoxic response of SNO cells was highest in cells treated with 34.64 µM FB1.
p6716
aVSNO cells treated with DEN + FB1 showed greater cytotoxicity than did cells treated with FB1 alone, whereas FB1 appeared to inhibit the cytotoxic effect exerted by CAT alone.
p6717
aVThe results of this study provide further evidence for the involvement of FB1 in the etiology of esophageal carcinoma.
p6718
aVApproximately 60-90% of human cancers are attributable to environmental factors, particularly chemical carcinogens (1).
p6719
aVTwo important groups of carcinogens that have emerged are the mycotoxins and N-nitrosamines.
p6720
aVFumonisin B1 (FB1) is a mycotoxin produced by the fungus Fusarium verticillioides, a ubiquitous soil-borne fungus that frequently contaminates maize and maize products.
p6721
aVFB1 is the most abundant and toxic of the known fumonisins and has been associated with many animal diseases, including equine leukoencephalomalacia (2), porcine pulmonary edema (3), and liver and kidney tumors in rats (4).
p6722
aVThe geographic areas where FB1 occurs in high concentrations have been associated with high rates of esophageal cancer (EC) in humans (5).
p6723
aVAlthough FB1 has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a type 2B carcinogen (6) and appears to be an initiator and promotor of carcinogenesis in rats (7),
p6724
aVwe have as yet no convincing evidence that FB1 is a human carcinogen.
p6725
aVMinute quantities of nitrosamines are present in cigarette smoke, alcoholic beverages, and certain foods,
p6726
aVbut their cumulative effect over several years could play a role in cancer.
p6727
aVN-nitrosamines are precarcinogens, giving rise to ultimate carcinogens only after enzymatic activation under acidic conditions in the stomach (8).
p6728
aVA possible correlation exists between EC and gastrectomy, that is, alkaline reflux into the esophagus.
p6729
aVThis could account for the mechanism by which ultimate carcinogens of nitrosamines reach the esophagus.
p6730
aVN-nitrosamines are organ specific, and in this regard, asymmetrical nitrosamines (e.g., N-nitrosomethylalanine and N-nitrosopiperidine) have a tendency to induce tumors of the esophagus (1).
p6731
aVMingxin et al.
p6732
aV(9) found that methylbenzylnitrosamine, nitrososarcosine ethyl ester, and other secondary amines induced carcinoma of the esophagus in rats.
p6733
aVHarris et al.
p6734
aV(10) reported that cultured human esophageal cells activated dimethylnitrosamine into DNA-binding metabolites.
p6735
aVF. verticillioides enhancement of nitrosamine-induced EC in rats has been reported by van Rensburg (11).
p6736
aVAlso, nitrosamines and their precursors have been found in foods from a high-EC area of China (12).
p6737
aVThese findings suggest that nitrosamines may play a role in the etiology of human esophageal carcinogenesis, possibly by acting synergistically with mycotoxins or other metabolites of F. verticillioides (13).
p6738
aVExcessive exposure to tobacco and alcohol has repeatedly been implicated as a principal factor in carcinoma of the esophagus (14,15).
p6739
aVTobacco and tobacco smoke contain many distinct classes of chemical carcinogens and cocarcinogens, including the N-nitrosamines, which are important environmental carcinogens.
p6740
aVDietary catechol (CAT), a constituent of cigarette smoke, was previously found to be a cocarcinogen with methyl-N-nitrosamine (MNAN) for inducing esophageal tumors in rats.
p6741
aVCAT in drinking water was not significantly cocarcinogenic with MNAN, but ethanol and CAT given in the drinking water was cocarcinogenic with MNAN and tumorigenic when given without MNAN (16).
p6742
aVThe increased carcinogenicity by MNAN occurs because ethanol and CAT affect MNAN metabolism.
p6743
aVThe human esophageal carcinoma cell line SNO was derived from a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (6.5 cm long and metastatic to the lymph nodes) that was explanted from patient S.N., a 62-year-old Zulu male, in July 1972 (17).
p6744
aVThere is sufficient evidence of the carcinogenicity of FB1 in test animals, but not enough data to draw definite conclusions for humans (18).
p6745
aVWe undertook this study to investigate whether FB1 is an etiologic agent in human esophageal carcinoma, as well as to review the cytotoxic effect of other etiologic factors in this disease.
p6746
aVIn this study we evaluated the cytotoxicity of FB1, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and CAT on the human SNO EC cell line.
p6747
aVMaterials.
p6748
aVWe purchased all cell culture media and plasticware from Sterilin (Durban, South Africa).
p6749
aVWe obtained methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) salt, DEN, and CAT from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA) and FB1 from the Programme on Mycotoxins and Experimental Carcinogenesis (Cape Town, South Africa).
p6750
aVWe purchased all solvents from Merck (Johannesburg, South Africa).
p6751
aVPreparation of toxin stock solutions.
p6752
aVWe prepared stock solutions of FB1, DEN, and CAT by dissolving 0.5 mg of each toxin in 30 µL ethanol, 170 µL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 4.8 mL complete culture medium (CCM; minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1% Penstrep fungizone, and 1% l-glutamine), thus yielding a toxin concentration of 100 µM.
p6753
aVThe control stock solution contained ethanol, DMSO, and CCM.
p6754
aVFor the cytotoxicity assay, we used serial dilutions (2.165-34.64 µM) prepared from the stock solution.
p6755
aVPreparation of the MTT salt.
p6756
aVWe dissolved MTT salt (5 mg) in 1 mL Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to give a concentration of 5 mg/mL.
p6757
aVWe then filtered the suspension through a 0.45-µm filter and stored it in the dark at room temperature until use.
p6758
aVThe MTT assay.
p6759
aVWe determined the cytotoxic effect of the toxins on SNO cells using the MTT assay.
p6760
aVWe washed two confluent monolayers in 75-cm3 culture flasks in CCM with HBSS, which we then trypsinized to detach cells from the flask.
p6761
aVWe removed the trypsin and replaced it with 15 mL CCM and gently shook the flasks to dislodge the cells.
p6762
aVWe assessed cell viability using trypan blue, determined cell numbers using a hemocytometer (19), and resuspended cells to give a cell count of 4.5 × 106 cells.
p6763
aVWe aliquoted the cell suspension (100 µL) into each well of two 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated them at 37°C.
p6764
aVAfter 24 hr, we replaced the CCM with 100 µL toxin at concentrations ranging from 2.165 to 34.64 µM, using five replicates for each serial dilution.
p6765
aVAfter a 48-hr incubation at 37°C, we removed the toxin and replaced it with 10 µL MTT (5 mg/mL) and 100 µL CCM, and then incubated the mixture for a further 4 hr.
p6766
aVWe subsequently removed the supernatant and aliquoted 100 µL DMSO into each well to solubilize any resulting formazan crystals.
p6767
aVAfter 1 hr, we determined the optical density of the resulting solution spectrophotometrically using a Bio-Rad (Johannesburg, South Africa) multiwell plate reader at 595 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm.
p6768
aVWe calculated cell viability from the absorbance values obtained.
p6769
aVWe then statistically analyzed the results using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons and Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney rank sum test for two-group comparisons.
p6770
aVWe constructed graphs to illustrate cell viability after calculation of the standard deviation.
p6771
aVWe considered data comparisons significant if p &lt; 0.05.
p6772
aVIn this study we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of FB1 and other etiologic agents (DEN and CAT) on SNO cells using the MTT assay.
p6773
aVWe observed minimal cytotoxicity in SNO cells exposed to FB1 over 48 hr compared with control cells (Figures 1 and 2), with FB1-treated cells showing a 23% cell mortality after 48-hr incubation with 34.64 µM FB1 (p &lt; 0.022).
p6774
aVThe low cytotoxic response by SNO cells at the concentrations tested is in agreement with other studies.
p6775
aVCawood et al.
p6776
aV(20) noted a low cytotoxic response in primary hepatocytes.
p6777
aVHowever, FB1 has been shown to be cytotoxic to certain mammalian cell lines (21,22),
p6778
aVsuggesting that some tissue may accumulate FB1 over time or may be more susceptible to the cancer-promoting ability of FB1.
p6779
aVThe effects of FB1 are chronic, as suggested by the late age of onset of EC (between 40 and 60 years).
p6780
aVFB1 is also poorly absorbed (experiments show that 90% of FB1 is directly excreted), which explains why FB1 is a slow-acting carcinogen (23).
p6781
aVApart from a chronic effect, the low toxic response over 48 hr by cells treated with FB1 may suggest that FB1 is more effective as a cancer promoter than an initiator of EC in humans.
p6782
aVThis disagrees with studies that show a toxic effect by FB1 in rat liver and kidney.
p6783
aVThe presence of an amino group and the location of the hydroxyl on C14/C15 may also play an important role in both the toxic and cancer-initiating activities of FB1.
p6784
aVThe presence of the amino group facilitates the conjugation of FB1 via gluteraldehyde to protein carriers (24).
p6785
aVThis would provide a plausible mechanism by which FB1 exerts its mitogenic effect.
p6786
aVCytotoxicity depends on the ability of a molecule to bind cellular receptors and/or penetrate the cell membrane (dependent on size, structural conformation, and polarity of the compound).
p6787
aVPolarity appears to be an important determinant in the cytotoxic behavior of FB1.
p6788
aVIn general, less polar molecules have higher cytotoxicity (25).
p6789
aVFB1 is a strongly polar compound (26).
p6790
aVThis explains the low cytotoxic response observed on treatment with FB1.
p6791
aVAnother possibility is that FB1 acts in synergy with a cocarcinogen that forms part of the etiology of EC.
p6792
aVIt therefore appears that SNO cells are more susceptible to combined treatment with DEN and FB1.
p6793
aVOne-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference between treatment with FB1 alone compared with treatment with DEN + FB1 at 34.64 µM (p &lt; 0.043), 17.32 µM (p &lt; 0.008), 8.66 µM (p &lt; 0.005), and 4.33 µM (p &lt; 0.03).
p6794
aVA cell mortality of 37% occurred upon treatment with DEN + FB1 (34.64 µM).
p6795
aVAt the same concentration, we observed only 9% cell mortality upon treatment with DEN alone.
p6796
aVFigure 1 shows the differences observed in cell viability after treating SNO cells with FB1, DEN, and DEN + FB1.
p6797
aVDEN is part of a widely acting group of potent carcinogens.
p6798
aVNitrosamines are metabolized by mixed-function oxidase enzymes to a chemically active alkylating agent in the rat and possibly in the human esophagus (27).
p6799
aVThis reaction produces alkylating intermediates that can form O6-alkylguanines from DNA guanine.
p6800
aVDNA guanine then pairs with thymine rather than cytosine.
p6801
aVIt is thought that this mispairing produces a mutation that initiates carcinogenesis (28).
p6802
aVIn support of this view, we detected elevated levels of O6-methylguanine in esophageal DNA extracted from EC patients in China (29).
p6803
aVWhen nitrosamines alkylate rat esophageal DNA and thereby initiate cancer, they are presumably activated by microsomes in the rat esophagus because the active metabolites do not travel in the blood from other organs to the esophagus (24).
p6804
aVThe same may apply to nitrosamine induction of EC in humans.
p6805
aVThe results suggest that DEN acts in concert with FB1 and may act as a cancer initiator to promote the activity of FB1.
p6806
aVThe cytotoxicities of FB1, CAT, and CAT + FB1 are shown in Figure 2.
p6807
aVCAT is cytotoxic to SNO cells, producing 44% cell mortality at 34.64 µM (p &lt; 0.03).
p6808
aVThis agrees with epidemiologic studies that have clearly demonstrated a strong positive association of chronic tobacco smoking with EC (14).
p6809
aVWe also observed a significant difference between FB1 treatment and FB1 + CAT at 4.33 µM (p &lt; 0.01) and 2.165 µM (p &lt; 0.038).
p6810
aVHowever, we found no significant differences in cytotoxic activity between treatment with FB1 alone and FB1 + CAT (23% and 28% cell death, respectively) when we assessed the entire range of concentrations against each other.
p6811
aVWhen CAT and FB1 co-occur, there seems to be a stimulation of cell growth or a reduction in mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity.
p6812
aVThe results of this study suggest that FB1 inhibits the effect of CAT on the cells, possibly by reducing binding sites for the toxin.
p6813
aVThe results show that FB1 alone is not overtly cytotoxic in humans, but that it may act as a promotor or initiator of carcinogenesis in synergy with certain cocarcinogens.
p6814
aVMiners inhaling respirable coal dust (CD) frequently develop coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, a dust-associated pneumoconiosis characterized by lung inflammation and variable fibrosis.
p6815
aVMany coal miners are also exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) components of diesel engine exhaust and cigarette smoke, which may contribute to lung disease in these workers.
p6816
aVRecently, apoptosis was reported to play a critical role in the development of another pneumoconiosis of miners, silicosis.
p6817
aVIn addition, CD was reported to suppress cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) induction by PAHs.
p6818
aVWe investigated the hypothesis that apoptosis plays a critical role in lung injury and down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs.
p6819
aVWe exposed rats intratracheally to 0.0, 2.5, 10.0, 20.0, or 40.0 mg/rat CD and, 11 days later, to intraperitoneal \u03b2-naphthoflavone (BNF), a PAH.
p6820
aVIn another group of rats exposed to CD and BNF, caspase activity was inhibited by injection of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH [quinoline-Val-Asp (OMe)-CH2-OPH].
p6821
aVIn rats exposed to BNF, CD exposure increased alveolar expression of the proapoptotic mediator Bax but decreased CYP1A1 induction relative to BNF exposure alone.
p6822
aVPan-caspase inhibition decreased CD-associated Bax expression and apoptosis but did not restore CYP1A1 activity.
p6823
aVFurther, CD-induced lung inflammation and alveolar epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia were not suppressed by caspase inhibition.
p6824
aVCombined BNF and CD exposure increased Bax expression and apoptosis in the lung, but Bax and apoptosis were not the major determinants of early lung injury in this model.
p6825
aVCoal miners are commonly exposed to coal dust (CD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
p6826
aVThe CD originates within the mine, whereas the PAHs are components of occupational and avocational exposures such as diesel engine exhaust and cigarette smoke.
p6827
aVThe CD exposure can cause coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, a disease of coal miners characterized by the aggregation of dust-laden macrophages near the respiratory bronchioles to form structures known as macules.
p6828
aVInflammation is a consistent feature of the pulmonary response to respirable CD (Ghanem et al.
p6829
aV2004; Rom et al.
p6830
aV1987).
p6831
aVAlthough chronic inflammation is increasingly believed to play a role in carcinogenesis in many tissues (Marx 2004), the role of particle-induced inflammation in pulmonary carcinogenesis, the influence of particle-induced inflammation on the metabolism of PAHs and other known carcinogens, and the histopathologic alterations produced by combined exposure to CD and PAHs remain incompletely investigated.
p6832
aVPAHs are metabolized to reactive intermediates by cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) gene products.
p6833
aVRecently, our laboratory has demonstrated that respirable CD inhibits PAH-induced CYP1A1 activity in the lung of rats.
p6834
aVThe down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction was associated with inflammation (Ghanem et al.
p6835
aV2004).
p6836
aVThis information suggests that CD may modify the metabolism of PAHs in the lung.
p6837
aVHowever, molecular changes that are associated with CD exposure and resulting pulmonary inflammation and down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction have not yet been identified.
p6838
aVIn an experimental model of another pneumoconiosis, silicosis, caspase inhibition with resulting apoptosis down-regulation reduces silica-induced inflammation (Borges et al.
p6839
aV2002).
p6840
aVCaspases play an important role in both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (Droin and Green 2004), making their inhibition an elegant tool for investigating the overall role of caspase-dependent apoptosis in the pneumoconioses (Borges et al.
p6841
aV2002).
p6842
aVBecause apoptosis is believed to play an essential role in the inflammation associated with one pneumoconiosis, acute silicosis, and because inflammation increased as CYP1A1 activity decreased in the rat model of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis (Ghanem et al.
p6843
aV2004), we investigated the hypothesis that apoptosis plays a critical role in lung injury and down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction in mixed exposures to CD and the model PAH \u03b2-naphthoflavone (BNF).
p6844
aVMale Sprague-Dawley rats [Hla(SD)CVF] were purchased from Hilltop Labs (Scottdale, PA) and kept in a barrier animal facility approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.
p6845
aVFood and water were supplied ad libitum.
p6846
aVRats were housed in ventilated shoebox cages on autoclaved hardwood (Beta-Chip; Northeastern Products Inc., Warrensburg, NY) and cellulose bedding (ALPHA-dri; Shepherd Specialty Papers, Watertown, TN) in filtered, ventilated cage racks (Thoren Caging System Inc., Hazleton, PA).
p6847
aVRats were acclimatized for 1 week before experiments.
p6848
aVThe animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering.
p6849
aVThe experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
p6850
aVWe conducted two separate experiments as part of this study.
p6851
aVThe first experiment was a 2-week CD dose\u2013response experiment, in which we randomized 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats (220\u2013270 g body weight at time of exposure) into five groups (eight rats per group) using a JavaScript random-number\u2013generating program (Research Randomizer; Urbaniak and Plous 2003).
p6852
aVWe intratracheally (IT) instilled 0.0, 2.5, 10.0, 20.0, or 40.0 mg/rat CD suspended in sterile saline to model CD exposures of coal miners as revealed in autopsy studies (Douglas et al.
p6853
aV1986; Kuempel et al.
p6854
aV2001).
p6855
aVEleven days later, we intraperitoneally (IP) injected the classic CYP1A1 inducer BNF (50 mg/kg) in all rats to model the PAH-exposed lung.
p6856
aVTwo weeks after CD exposure, rats were euthanized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital.
p6857
aVThis experiment determined the relationship between CD exposure and expression of the apoptosis mediator Bax.
p6858
aVThis study also localized Bax expression relative to the expression of CYP1A1 and cytokeratin 8/18, an alveolar type II cell marker.
p6859
aVThe second experiment was designed to inhibit apoptosis in rats exposed to CD and BNF.
p6860
aVIn this experiment, we randomized 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats (67\u201393 g body weight at time of exposure) into four groups (Table 1).
p6861
aVWe instilled each rat IT with either CD (40 mg/rat) suspended in 0.3 mL saline or saline alone (controls).
p6862
aVTo inhibit apoptosis, we injected the rats IP with the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH [quinoline-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH2-OPH; 15 mg/kg] dissolved in the vehicle [dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)] or the vehicle alone (controls) on the day of CD exposure.
p6863
aVWe injected 10 mg/kg Q-VD-OPH on days 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 postexposure to maintain caspase inhibition, whereas controls received injections of the vehicle.
p6864
aVEleven days after CD exposure, we induced CYP1A1 in all rats by IP injection of BNF (50 mg/kg) in corn oil.
p6865
aVThis allowed us to determine if apoptosis was etiologically associated with lung changes seen in CD-exposed rats, including a) suppression of CYP1A1 activity and CYP1A1 tissue expression, b) suppression of CYP2B1 activity, and c) histopathologic alterations in lung tissue.
p6866
aVIn addition, we evaluated Bax expression and apoptosis to determine the efficacy of in vivo caspase inhibition with Q-VD-OPH.
p6867
aVCD particles from the Pittsburgh coal seam were a generous gift from V. Vallyathan (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health).
p6868
aVThese were separated and characterized as previously described (Vallyathan et al.
p6869
aV1988).
p6870
aVThe particles were representative low-silica\u2013content CD particles, with 2.3% of the particles numerically being silica.
p6871
aVThe CD particles were &lt; 5 \u03bcm in diameter with a surface area of 7.4 m2/g and a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.4 \u03bcm.
p6872
aVThe particles contained 0.34% total iron with a 0.119% surface iron content.
p6873
aVWe sterilized the particles in an oven at 160°C for 2 hr.
p6874
aVWe freshly suspended the sterile CD particles in nonpyrogenic sterile 0.9% saline (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) by vortexing and shaking before instillation.
p6875
aVWe prepared solutions of 2% (wt/wt) Q-VD-OPH (Enzyme Systems Products Inc., Livermore, CA) in endotoxin-free DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).
p6876
aVWe prepared a 50 mg/mL suspension of BNF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as previously described (Ghanem et al.
p6877
aV2004).
p6878
aVRats were euthanized by IP injection of sodium pentobarbital (\u2265 100 mg/kg) (Sleepaway; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) 2 weeks after CD instillation.
p6879
aVThe right mainstem bronchus was ligated, and right lung lobes were collected and immediately placed on ice for isolation of microsomes.
p6880
aVThe left lung lobe was inflated with 3.0 mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin, trimmed the same day, processed in a tissue processor overnight, and embedded in paraffin the following morning.
p6881
aVMicrosomes were prepared as previously described (Ma et al.
p6882
aV2002).
p6883
aVWe measured 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD) activities as previously described (Burke et al.
p6884
aV1985; Ma et al.
p6885
aV2002).
p6886
aVWe conducted lung microsome Western blots as previously described (Ghanem et al.
p6887
aV2004) with minor adaptation by using a 15-well Novex tris glycine gel (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 30 \u03bcg protein.
p6888
aVDensitometry values were expressed as the percentage of the CYP1A1- or CYP2B1-positive controls.
p6889
aVWe deparaffinized lung sections and blocked nonspecific binding as previously described (Ghanem et al.
p6890
aV2004).
p6891
aVWe rinsed the slides with distilled water and incubated them with a 1:20 dilution of affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-Bax antibody (sc-526; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at room temperature followed by 2 hr at 37°C.
p6892
aVAlexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was the secondary antibody.
p6893
aVNonimmune rabbit serum (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) was used for the negative control.
p6894
aVWe conducted double-label immunofluorescence for localization of CYP1A1 and cytokeratin 8/18 as previously described (Ghanem et al.
p6895
aV2004).
p6896
aVTriple-label immunofluorescence for Bax, CYP1A1, and cytokeratin 8/18 localizes the expression of Bax and CYP1A1 in alveolar type II cells (alveolar type II cells contain abundant cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 18).
p6897
aVWe simultaneously applied polyclonal antibodies for Bax (rabbit anti-Bax; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CYP1A1 (goat anti-CYP1A1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and cytokeratin 8/18 (guinea pig anti-cytokeratin 8/18; Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ) at dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5, respectively, and incubated the slides overnight in a humidified chamber at room temperature followed by 2 hr at 37°C.
p6898
aVThe slides were then incubated with a secondary antibody mixture containing Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), Alexa 350-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes), and fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013labeled donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (Research Diagnostics) antibodies for detection of Bax, CYP1A1, and cytokeratin 8/18, respectively.
p6899
aVWhen viewed with the fluorescent microscope, Bax appears red, CYP1A1 appears blue, and cytokeratin 8/18 appears green.
p6900
aVWe examined the slides with an Olympus fluorescent photomicroscope (Olympus AX70; Olympus American Inc., Lake Success, NY) using three filters: green (460\u2013500 nm excitation), red (532.5\u2013587.5 nm excitation) and blue (460\u2013500 nm excitation).
p6901
aVFor each emission wavelength, we photographed five images from the proximal alveolar region, which are alveoli located near the first alveolar ducts from the terminal bronchioles, the alveolar region most affected by particle deposition.
p6902
aVWe used a Quantix digital camera (Quantix Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) with QED camera plug-in software (QED Imaging Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), and held contrast, brightness and gamma settings constant.
p6903
aVWe measured the area of Bax immunofluorescence in the alveolar septum using a MetaMorph Imaging System (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA).
p6904
aVIn addition, we counted the number of cells expressing Bax per 40× field.
p6905
aVWe used the MetaMorph Imaging System to measure the area of alveolar tissue labeled by fluorochromes indicating expression of Bax (red), CYP1A1 (blue), and cytokeratin 8/18 (green).
p6906
aVWe also measured the co-localization of Bax, CYP1A1, and cytokeratin 8/18.
p6907
aVProportional CYP1A1 expression in alveolar type II cells corrected for particle-induced increases in the cells and was the area of blue fluorescence (representing CYP1A1) co-localized with green (representing cytokeratin 8/18) divided by the total green area.
p6908
aVIn each 40× microscopic field, we also counted the number of alveolar type II cells expressing Bax (red cells) and the number of alveolar type II cells expressing both CYP1A1 and Bax.
p6909
aVWe conducted terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) as previously described (Gavrieli et al.
p6910
aV1992) using a TUNEL assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI).
p6911
aVBriefly, we incubated deparaffinized slides with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme and the nucleotide mix.
p6912
aVWe applied propidium iodide as a counterstain.
p6913
aVFor a positive control, we incubated slides with DNase 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) and for a negative control, we incubated slides without the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme.

aVHistopathologic changes were semiquantitatively scored on a scale ranging from to 5 for both severity and distribution to produce a sum pathology score of to 10 for each slide (Hubbs et al.
p6917
aV1997).
p6918
aVWe analyzed data using SAS/STAT software (version 8.2 of SAS System for Windows; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
p6919
aVFor Bax area and Bax-labeled cells per field, we used the Proc Reg procedure.
p6920
aVWe analyzed variables in the CD response study with a one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the Proc Mixed procedure.
p6921
aVWe analyzed effects of the caspase inhibitor using a two-factor ANOVA and compared different alveolar regions using a three-factor split-unit ANOVA using Proc Mixed.
p6922
aVWe used Fisher\u2019s least significant difference test for all post hoc pairwise comparisons.
p6923
aVWe used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for pairwise comparisons of pathology scores.
p6924
aVAll results were considered statistically significant at p \u2264 0.05.
p6925
aVIn the proximal alveolar region, CD increased the area of Bax expression in a dose-dependent manner (r2 = 0.6541, p \u2264 0.001) (Figure 1A; AND Outline Supplemental Figure 1; AND Outline available AND Outline online AND Outline at AND Outline http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/8906/suppl.pdf).
p6926
aVAND Outline In addition, the average number of lung cells expressing Bax in the proximal alveolar region was increased in a dose-dependent fashion by CD exposure (r2 = 0.903, p \u2264 0.001)
p6927
aVIn rats exposed to BNF, CYP1A1 was strongly expressed (Figure 2A); however, CD exposure decreased BNF-induced CYP1A1 expression (Figure 2B).
p6928
aVIn rats exposed to BNF alone, Bax was rarely expressed (Figure 2C), but it was frequently expressed in alveolar cells from rats exposed to CD and BNF (Figure 2D).
p6929
aVSmall numbers of cytokeratin 8/18\u2013containing alveolar type II cells were observed in rats exposed to BNF alone (Figure 2E).
p6930
aVCD increased the size and number of alveolar type II cells in BNF-exposed rats (Figure 2F).
p6931
aVThe percentage of alveolar type II cells coexpressing Bax was marginally increased (p = 0.052) with CD exposure (Figure 2G; Outline Supplemental Material, Outline Figure Outline 2; Outline available Outline online Outline at Outline http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/8906/suppl.pdf).
p6932

p6934
aVIn rats exposed to both CD and BNF, Q-VD-OPH significantly reduced the area of Bax expression (p &lt; 0.001) (Figure 3A\u2013E) and the number of cells expressing Bax per field (p = 0.001) (Figure 3A\u2013D,F).
p6935
aVHowever, in BNF-exposed rats, Q-VD-OPH did not completely eliminate CD-associated increases in Bax expression (Figure 3D\u2013F); the area of Bax expression (Figure 3E) and the number of cells expressing Bax per field (Figure 3F) were significantly increased by CD exposure (p = 0.005 and p \u2264 0.001, respectively) despite Q-VD-OPH treatment.
p6936
aVWe evaluated the effect of CD on PAH-induced CYP1A1 within alveoli in rats exposed to BNF (the model PAH) in the alveolar region of the lung most affected by particle deposition, the proximal alveolar region.
p6937
aVWithin alveolar septa stained for both CYP1A1 and cytokeratin 8/18, the area of BNF-induced CYP1A1 expression localized to cells without the alveolar type II markers (cytokeratin 8/18) was significantly reduced (p \u2264 0.001) by CD exposure (Figure 4A; Outline Supplemental Material, Outline Figure Outline 3; Outline available Outline online Outline at Outline http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/8906/suppl.pdf).
p6938
aVOutline In addition, the proportional CYP1A1 expression in alveolar type II cells was significantly reduced (p = 0.0028) by CD exposure in BNF-injected rats (Figure 4B; Outline Supplemental Figure 3, Outline available Outline online Outline at Outline http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/8906/suppl.pdf).
p6939
aVOutline Q-VD-OPH did not significantly affect CYP1A1 immunofluorescence in the alveolus of rats exposed to BNF or to BNF and CD (Figure 4).
p6940
aVHistopathologic alterations associated with CD exposure in BNF-treated rats included histiocytic and suppurative alveolitis with accumulation of dark brown particles within the cytoplasm of many alveolar macrophages, and alveolar epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia (Figure 5A).
p6941
aVCaspase inhibition did not significantly affect these histopathologic changes of CD- and BNF-exposed rats (Figure 5B,E).
p6942
aVWe did not observe histopathologic changes in the lungs of rats instilled IT with vehicle control and injected with BNF or BNF and Q-VD-OPH.
p6943
aVHowever, CD exposure significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells (p \u2264 0.048; Figure 5C) in the proximal alveolar region, whereas caspase inhibition with Q-VD-OPH significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells in the proximal alveolar region of the CD-exposed rats (p = 0.013; Figure 5D,F).
p6944
aVThe proximal alveolar region had a higher percentage of apoptotic cells than did random alveolar regions from rats with the same exposures (p = 0.013, p \u2264 0.001, p = 0.025, and p &lt; 0.001 for saline/BNF/DMSO, CD/BNF/DMSO, saline/BNF/inhibitor, and CD/BNF/inhibitor, respectively; Figure 5F).
p6945
aVTwo forms of CYP were selected for evaluation, the PAH-inducible CYP1A1 and the major constitutive isoform of the rat lung, CYP2B1.
p6946
aVTo determine if Bax expression or apoptosis inhibited the activity of CYP1A1- or CYP2B1-dependent reactions, we measured pulmonary EROD and PROD activity.
p6947
aVBNF-induced EROD activity was significantly reduced (p \u2264 0.05) in CD-exposed rats but unaffected by the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH (Figure 6A).
p6948
aVAlso, CD significantly reduced PROD activity in BNF-treated rats, and this effect persisted when caspases were inhibited by Q-VD-OPH (Figure 6B).
p6949
aVCD exposure significantly reduced the amount of CYP1A1 protein in the lungs of BNF-exposed rats (p \u2264 0.05; Figure 7), but the amount of CYP1A1 protein was unaffected by caspase inhibition with Q-VD-OPH (Figure 7).
p6950
aVSimilarly, the amount of CYP2B1 was not significantly affected by caspase inhibition with Q-VD-OPH (data not shown).
p6951
aVHigh tissue concentrations of respirable CD accumulate in the human lung in coal miners.
p6952
aVFor example, in an autopsy study, the actual measured dust burden (mean ± SD) in the lung of nonsmoking coal miners was 16.4 ± 8.5 g (Kuempel et al.
p6953
aV2001).
p6954
aVHowever, most epidemiologic studies indicate no increased risk of lung cancer in coal miners (Kuempel et al.
p6955
aV1995).
p6956
aVA potential difficulty in interpreting the human lung cancer epidemiology studies of CD is the potential confounding from exposure to tobacco, a known lung carcinogen that contains abundant PAHs.
p6957
aVThis is extremely important in coal miners because in studies where smoking status is known, most coal miners are smokers (Vallyathan et al.
p6958
aV1985).
p6959
aVIn addition, diesel engine exhaust and other sources of PAHs are present within coal mines.
p6960
aVIn our study, we have confirmed our previous finding that in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs, CD appears to modify PAH metabolism by inhibiting CYP1A1 induction (Ghanem et al.
p6961
aV2004).
p6962
aVIn the present study, we also found that CD, like many other agents that cause chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, increases pulmonary apoptosis and increases expression of the pro-apoptotic mediator Bax.
p6963
aVPrevious studies suggest that apoptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of a diverse group of fibrosing lung diseases, including diffuse alveolar damage, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Kuwano et al.
p6964
aV1999), and silicosis (Borges et al.
p6965
aV2002).
p6966
aVIn this study, we demonstrate for the first time that in vivo treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH significantly decreases apoptosis and Bax expression in the lung.
p6967
aVBecause caspases are mediators of apoptosis, decreased apoptosis is an expected result of caspase inhibition (Caserta et al.
p6968
aV2003).
p6969
aVAlthough somewhat unexpected, caspase inhibition of Bax expression in our study suggests that caspases play a role in Bax expression in this model.
p6970
aVImportantly, immunohistochemical detection of Bax expression in lung correlates well with apoptosis and the expression of other apoptosis mediators (Kuwano et al.
p6971
aV2000; Plataki et al.
p6972
aV2005).
p6973
aVHowever, the relationship between increased Bax expression in tissue sections and Bax activation has not been investigated thoroughly.
p6974
aVCD-associated histopathologic alterations, such as alveolitis and alveolar epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, were unaffected by caspase inhibition and decreased apoptosis.
p6975
aVOther pan-caspase inhibitors, such as N-benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone and BOC-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone, have been reported to reduce neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of silicotic mice by 50% (Borges et al.
p6976
aV2002).
p6977
aVHowever, in the present study, the principally histiocytic inflammatory reaction in the lungs of CD-exposed rats was not significantly suppressed by the injection of Q-VD-OPH.
p6978
aVBecause the histopathologic changes associated with silica exposure involve more neutrophils and are more proliferative than CD-induced pulmonary injury (Green 2000; Kuempel et al.
p6979
aV2003), these morphologic differences may influence the ability to attenuate silicotic injury through apoptosis inhibition.
p6980
aVIt may also be that the role of apoptosis in CD- and PAH-induced lung injury is similar to the role of apoptosis in oxygen toxicity, where apoptosis contributes to cell death but caspase inhibition does not significantly alter alveolar damage (Barazzone et al.
p6981
aV1998).
p6982
aVAlternatively, Bax expression and apoptosis in the CD- and PAH-exposed lung may be involved in resolution of lung injury, as has been suggested in the lipopolysaccharide-exposed lung (Wang et al.
p6983
aV2002).
p6984
aVThe present study clearly indicates that apoptosis is not a major contributor to early morphologic injury in the CD- and PAH-exposed rat lung.
p6985
aVChanges in cellular mediators or signaling cascades that produce Bax activation and increase apoptosis may have a role in CYP down-regulation.
p6986
aVPotential candidates would include mediators of particle-induced inflammation including p53, nitric oxide, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and/or initiators of alveolar epithelial proliferation.
p6987
aVIndeed, in vitro studies indicate down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and activated NF-\u03baB (Tian et al.
p6988
aV2003).
p6989
aVIn summary, our findings indicate that, in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs, CD modifies important processes associated with the pulmonary response to xenobiotics, notably down-regulating xenobiotic metabolism and increasing apoptosis.

aVHowever, our findings do not support the hypothesis that apoptosis plays a critical role in early lung injury and the down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs.
p6991
aVTherefore, suppression of CYP2B1 and inducible CYP1A1 following CD and PAH exposure is associated with, but not caused by, up-regulation of Bax expression and apoptosis of alveolar cells.
p6992
aVThe mechanism(s) by which arsenic exposure contributes to human cancerrisk is unknown; however, several indirect cocarcinogenesis mechanismshave been proposed.
p6993
aVMany studies support the role of As in altering oneor more DNA repair processes.
p6994
aVIn the present study we used individual-levelexposure data and biologic samples to investigate the effectsof As exposure on nucleotide excision repair in two study populations, focusingon the excision repair cross-complement 1 (ERCC1) component.
p6995
aVWemeasured drinking water, urinary, or toenail As levels and obtainedcryopreserved lymphocytes of a subset of individuals enrolled in epidemiologicstudies in New Hampshire (USA) and Sonora (Mexico).
p6996
aVAdditionally, incorroborative laboratory studies, we examined the effects ofAs on DNA repair in a cultured human cell model.
p6997
aVArsenic exposure wasassociated with decreased expression of ERCC1 in isolated lymphocytesat the mRNA and protein levels.
p6998
aVIn addition, lymphocytes from As-exposedindividuals showed higher levels of DNA damage, as measured by acomet assay, both at baseline and after a 2-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene (2-AAAF) challenge.
p6999
aVInsupport of the in vivo data, As exposure decreased ERCC1 mRNA expression and enhanced levelsof DNA damage after a 2-AAAF challenge in cell culture.
p7000
aVThese data providefurther evidence to support the ability of As to inhibit the DNArepair machinery, which is likely to enhance the genotoxicity and mutagenicityof other directly genotoxic compounds, as part of a cocarcinogenicmechanism of action.
p7001
aVArsenic is an established lung, skin, and bladder carcinogen [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2004]; however, the carcinogenic mechanisms are currently under investigation.
p7002
aVBasedprimarily on studies of highly exposed populations inTaiwan and elsewhere, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recentlyreduced the maximum contaminant level (MCL) standard for arsenicin drinking water from 50 \u03bcg/L to 10 \u03bcg/L (U.S. EPA 2006).
p7003
aVAtthe lower end of the dose\u2013response curve, the biologiceffects and magnitude of disease risk in the human population remainunknown (Abernathy et al.
p7004
aV1999).
p7005
aVHowever, a growing number of laboratory studies, both in cell culturesand in experimental animals, have demonstrated biologic effects ofAs at very low levels equivalent to those below the new 10 \u03bcg/Lstandard.
p7006
aVThese effects include endocrine disruption, altered cell signaling, alteredcell cycle kinetics, alterations in proliferative response, andother effects that may be associated with carcinogenesis andother disease processes (reviewed by Rossman 2003).
p7007
aVThus, it is important to understand the potential adverse effects ofsuch exposure in the human population.
p7008
aVAn estimated 2% of the drinking water serving U.S. households contains \u2265 2 \u03bcg/L As (National Research Council 2001).
p7009
aVApproximately 40% of households in the state of New Hampshireare served by unregulated private wells, with homeowner-financed, optionalcontaminant testing.
p7010
aVMoreover, until recent studies revealed theextent of geologic As contamination of drinking water in the state (Peters et al.
p7011
aV1999), As was not part of the standard laboratory water testing panel.
p7012
aVCase\u2013controlstudies of bladder and skin cancer conducted in the NewHampshire population have detected evidence of elevated cancer risks.
p7013
aVForbladder cancer, an excess risk was observed primarily among smokersexposed to As in the drinking water, supporting hypotheses that theselevels of As are cocarcinogenic (Karagas et al.
p7014
aV2001, 2004).
p7015
aVLikewise, drinking water in the southwestern United States and northernMexico contains As at concentrations above the new MCL of 10 \u03bcg/L (Meza et al.
p7016
aV2004).
p7017
aVThe precise mechanism of As cocarcinogenesis is unknown.
p7018
aVIt has been difficultto detect genotoxic effects of As per se at environmental levels [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 1999; IARC 2004; Rossman 2003].
p7019
aVHowever, many studies support the role of As in altering oneor more DNA repair processes [World Health Organization (WHO) 2001].
p7020
aVArsenic has been shown to potentiate the genotoxicity of otherorganic mutagen-carcinogens, particularly poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), includingbenzo[a]pyrene (BAP) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (ATSDR 1999; Rossman 2003).
p7021
aVRats treated with As and BAP sustained adduct burdens longer than didrats treated with BAP alone, suggesting impairment of DNA repair byAs as a possible mechanism (Tran et al.
p7022
aV2002).
p7023
aVA study using human fibroblasts found that low (2.5 \u03bcM, ~ 180 \u03bcg/L) concentrations of arsenite reduced nucleotide excisionrepair efficiency, and incision frequency in particular, after UVR exposure (Hartwig et al.
p7024
aV1997).
p7025
aVResults of another study in cultured human fibroblasts indicated thatAs exposure reduced DNA repair capacity as measured by the comet assay (Curnow et al.
p7026
aV2001).
p7027
aVThe effects of As are strongly dose, time, and species dependent (Barchowsky et al.
p7028
aV1999; WHO 2001).
p7029
aVIn particular, several As-induced effects exhibit a biphasic characteristic.
p7030
aVForexample, low (\u2264 1\u20132 \u03bcM) doses ofAs in cell culture increase cell proliferation and enhance endocrine signaling, whereashigher but still noncytotoxic doses (2\u20135 \u03bcM) suppressthese same pathways (Barchowsky et al.
p7031
aV1999).
p7032
aVLikewise, patterns of altered gene expression, as detected by DNA microarraystudies, demonstrated very different patterns at low versus higherdoses (Andrew et al.
p7033
aV2003b).
p7034
aVThus, although animal and cell culture studies provide controlled modelsystems for mechanistic studies of As, it is critical to understandwhich of these findings translate into cellular, molecular, and clinicaleffects in actual human exposure situations, and the role of thesein pathophysiologic processes such as carcinogenesis.
p7035
aVIn our preliminarystudy of human lymphocytes from individuals exposed to drinking waterAs, As exposure was correlated in a strongly dose-dependent mannerto decreased expression of three nucleotide excision repair genes: ERCC1, XPB, and XPF (Andrew et al.
p7036
aV2003a).
p7037
aVThe objective of this investigation was to evaluate our preliminary observationof an association between As exposure, focusing on ERCC1 gene expression levels in a larger number of individuals with exposuredata and biologic samples.
p7038
aVIn addition to gene expression, we investigatedthe effects of As exposure at both the protein and DNA repair functionallevels.
p7039
aVWe then extended our investigation into another populationexposed to similar levels of As in Mexico and also performed in vitro As experiments to validate our results in a controlled system.
p7040
aVWe used Jurkat lymphoblast cells as a controlled in vitro system to evaluate the effects of As on DNA damage and repair.
p7041
aVCells weregrown in suspension in RPMI medium containing l -glutamine with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA, USA).
p7042
aVCells were exposed to 0.01\u201310 \u03bcMsodium arsenite (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), which is equivalent to 0.75\u2013750 \u03bcg/L, for a period of 24 hr before harvestingand RNA isolation for gene expression analysis.
p7043
aVCells were exposed inculture to or 1 \u03bcM (equivalent to 75 \u03bcg/L) As as sodiumarsenite for 24 hr before the comet assay was performed, as describedbelow.

aVRNA was harvested using Trizol reagent (Gibco/BRL Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) followed by DNase digestion using DNAfree (AmbionInc., Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructionsand quantitated by spectrophotometric absorbance at 260 nm.
p7045
aVWeperformed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) usinggene-specific primers and reagents (Applied Biosystems, FosterCity, CA, USA) and the ABI PRISM sequence detection system and software (AppliedBiosystems).
p7046
aVBriefly, total RNA (0.5 \u03bcg) wasreverse transcribed using 100 U M-MLV (Maloney murine leukemia virus) reversetranscriptase in a mixture with oligo-dT and dNTPs (deoxyribonucleotidetriphosphates) according to the instructions provided with theQiagen Omniscript kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
p7047
aVSamples were reversetranscribed in a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA, USA) for 60 minat 44°C, and the reaction was terminatedby heating to 95°C for 10 min.
p7048
aVExpression of ERCC1 [excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementationgroup 1; GenBank gene ID 2067 (GenBank 2006)] was assessed by real-time PCR using 10 ng total RNA, 400 nMprimers, 200 nM probe, and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
p7049
aVThesequence for the ERCC1 primer probe set is as follows: forward, CAGGACTTCGTCTCCCGGT; probe, TCTGGAACAGCTCATCGCCGCA; reverse, GCATAAGGCCAGATCTTCT-CTTG.
p7050
aVRelative quantitation was performed using astandard curve consisting of serial dilutions of pooled sample cDNA fromthe same source as the test RNA with each plate.
p7051
aVRelative expressionlevels of each gene were normalized to 18s rRNA or GAPDH (Applied Biosystems).
p7052
aVWe assessed the level of ERCC1 protein by immunoblotting using sodium dodecylsulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) toresolve proteins from whole-cell lysates.
p7053
aVLymphocytes were rinsed withice-cold stop buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mMNaF, 200 mM sucrose, 100 \u03bcM Na-orthovanadate, 5 mM pyrophosphate, 4 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 4 \u03bcg/mL soybean trypsininhibitor, 1 mM benzamidine, 20 \u03bcM calpain inhibitor 1, 100 mU/mLaprotinin, and 100 \u03bcM phenylmethyl-sulfonylfluoride).
p7054
aVThestop buffer was then replaced with a minimal volume of 2× SDS-PAGEbuffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% \u03b2-mercap-toethanol, 0.05% wt/vol bromophenolblue).
p7055
aVThe lysates were boiled for 5 min and clarified by centrifugationat 13,000 rpm for 10 min.
p7056
aVEqual amounts of cell lysate wereresolved by electrophoresis on 8\u201312% SDS-polyacrylamidegels.
p7057
aVElectrophoresis was performed at constant voltage (200 V), andthen the resolved proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamidegel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF; Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) bysemidry transfer (Hoeffer Semiphor, San Francisco, CA, USA) for 1 hrat constant current (32 mA/minigel) using transferbuffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% vol/vol methanol, 0.01% SDS).
p7058
aVToeliminate non-specific interactions of antibodieswith the membrane, the PVDF membrane was blocked with TTBS (10 mMTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) containing 5% milk (wt/vol) for 1 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
p7059
aVThemembrane was incubated with the primary ERCC1 antibody (Neomarkers; LabVision Co., Fremont, CA, USA) diluted 1:200 in TTBS overnightat 4°C.
p7060
aVThe membrane was washed three times with TTBSand incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2013linked sheep anti-mouseIgG (1:2,000 in TTBS) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 0.5\u20131 hr at room temperature.
p7061
aVAfter three washes withTTBS, protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence usingthe Renaissance system (NEN Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA) and film (Lumi-Film; RocheMolecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
p7062
aVThe single-cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay is widely used to measureDNA damage and repair in primary human lymphocytes by measuringstrand breaks and apurinic sites (Baltaci et al.

aV2002; De Silva et al.
p7064
aV2000; Rajaee-Behbahani et al.
p7065

p7066
aV2001).
p7067
aVWe divided the lymphocyte sample from each individual into parts toassess damage at several time points.
p7068
aVWe assessed baseline DNA damagelevels as well as the capacity of the lymphocytes to repair damage inducedby an in vitro challenge with 2-acetoxyacetyl-aminofluorene (2-AAAF; Midwest ResearchInstitute, Kansas City, MO, USA), the reactive and genotoxic metaboliteof 2-acetyl-aminofluorene.
p7069
aVAlkaline-labile 2-AAAF adducts are primarilyrepaired through the nucleotide excision repair pathway (van Steeg 2001).
p7070
aVAliquots of lymphocytes were challenged for 2 hr in vitro with 4 \u03bcM 2-AAAF.
p7071
aVA subset of 2-AAAF\u2013challenged lymphocyteswere incubated for an additional 4 hr to allow for DNA repair ofthe lesions.
p7072
aVComet analysis was performed using materials and protocolsfrom Trevigen Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
p7073
aVBriefly, cells were mixedwith agarose and spread over a warmed, precoated microscope slide.
p7074
aVTheagarose was allowed to solidify for 30 min at 4°C, followedby immersion in prechilled lysis solution for 45 min or overnight.
p7075
aVNext, theslides were placed in freshly prepared alkaline solution, pH &gt; 13, for 30 minat room temperature.
p7076
aVThe slides were then washed twiceby immersion in 1× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer for 5 min.
p7077
aVElectrophoresiswas carried out in alkaline buffer for 20 min at 1 V/cm (measuredelectrode to electrode) in the dark.
p7078
aVLast, the slides were dippedinto 70% ethanol for 5 min, allowed to dry completely, andstained with SYBR green (Trevigen).
p7079
aVImage analysis of each cell wasperformed to quantify the length of the comet and the intensity of staining.
p7080
aVAllcells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope coupledto the MD Biotech comet assay image analysis system (Morgantown, WV, USA).
p7081
aVTheOlive tail moment is a unitless measure of DNA damage that wascalculated as described previously (Olive et al.
p7082
aV1990) using the quantity of migrated DNA multiplied by the distance betweenthe comet head and the center of gravity of the DNA in the comet tail.
p7083
aVThequantity of migrated DNA is the fraction of the DNA that has migratedfrom the head.
p7084
aVThe quantity of DNA is assessed as the DNA stainingintensity subtracted from the background intensity.
p7085
aVWe scored the tailmoment of all cells in a given well.
p7086
aVEach point represents an averageof 50 lymphocytes per individual (for human studies) or culture (for in vitro studies) from at least three to nine individuals or six cultures.
p7087
aVWe performed statistical analysis for gene expression and immunoblottingusing analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls posttest, unpaired t-test, or linear regression procedures in GraphPad PRISM software (GraphPadSoftware Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
p7088
aVWe considered p-values &lt; 0.05 to be statistically significant.
p7089
aVStatistical computationsand graphics for comet analysis were performed using the S-Plus statisticalpackage (version 6.2; Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA).
p7090
aVWeplotted the mean Olive tail moment with 95% confidenceinterval (CI) for each treatment group as a function of time.
p7091
aVWe performedan unpaired two-sided t-test to compare the low- and high-As groups at each time point.
p7092
aVLinearregression was used to assess the slopes of the lines.
p7093
aVCorresponding p-values are indicated.
p7094
aVDemographic characteristics of the study populations are shown in Table 1.
p7095
aVA larger percentage of the subjects in Mexico were female.
p7096
aVIn addition, theMexican population tended to be younger, with a mean age of 37 years, comparedto a mean age of 64 years in New Hampshire subjects.
p7097
aVApproximatelyone-third of each population consisted of smokers.
p7098
aVAs shown in Figure 1, analysis of both As-exposed populations combined indicated that individualsexposed to drinking water As concentrations \u2265 6 \u03bcg/L (n = 11) had lower ERCC1 gene expression levels than those with &lt; 6 \u03bcg/L As (n = 42; p &lt; 0.05).
p7099
aVThe Mexican population alone had a lower ERCC1 level among individuals exposed to As \u2265 6 \u03bcg/L, althoughthis was not statistically significant.
p7100
aVLikewise, a lower ERCC1 level was observed in the New Hampshire individuals exposed to \u2265 6 \u03bcg/LAs (statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05).
p7101
aVWe further assessed As exposure using available internal biomarkers ofAs level.
p7102
aVHowever, different biomarkers were used in the two populations, whichprevented pooling.
p7103
aVMeasurements included toenail As for theNew Hampshire population and urinary As for the Mexican population.
p7104
aVThesemarkers correlate with drinking water As concentration (Karagas et al.
p7105
aV2000).
p7106
aVLinear regression analysis of the New Hampshire population indicatedan inverse association between toenail As levels and ERCC1 expression (r2 = 0.4; p &lt; 0.05).
p7107
aVERCC1 expression decreased with increasing inorganic urinary As level [As(III) + As(V)] but not total urinary As (which mayinclude organic As), although this was not statistically significant (r2 = 0.08; p = 0.3).
p7108
aVIn the New Hampshire population, we found no differencein ERCC1 expression level according to cancer status (p = 0.8).
p7109
aVFor both populations, ERCC1 expression did not significantly differ by smoking status, age, or sex (datanot shown).
p7110
aVWe went on to investigate whether the decreased gene expression levelsthat we observed in lymphocytes of subjects exposed to As in New Hampshiretranslated to changes in protein levels.
p7111
aVImmunoblots using an ERCC1 antibodyindicated lower levels of ERCC1 protein among individualsexposed to drinking water As levels &gt; 5 \u03bcg/L (p &lt; 0.05), although there was some interindividual variation in expression (representativeblot shown in Figure 2A, quantification shown in Figure 2B).
p7112
aVAdditionally, we hypothesized that As exposure would be associated withcorrespondingly higher DNA damage levels and reduced DNA repair function.
p7113
aVWeanalyzed human lymphocytes from a subset of New Hampshire residentsexposed to low (&lt; 0.7 \u03bcg/L) or high (\u2265 13\u201393 \u03bcg/L) levels of drinking water As using the comet assay (Figure 3).
p7114
aVWe detected higher levels of DNA damage, as indicated by larger Olivetail moments, for lymphocytes analyzed at baseline from individualsexposed to high levels of drinking water As in vivo compared with those from lower level exposures (time hr; p &lt; 0.05).
p7115
aVAnalysis of these cells at 2 hr after 2-AAAF challenge demonstrateda dramatic increase in DNA damage but did not reveal any statisticallysignificant differences in the amount of damage at 2 hr byAs exposure status (p = 0.25).
p7116
aVHowever, at the 6-hr time point, after the 4-hr repairperiod, significantly higher levels of DNA damage remained in lymphocytesfrom individuals exposed to high compared with low levels of As in vivo (p &lt; 0.05) (Figure 4).
p7117
aVControl lymphocytes that did not receive in vitro challenge showed similar levels of DNA damage at the 6-hr time point (Figure 4).
p7118
aVThe difference in slopes of the low- and high-As lines was not statisticallysignificant.
p7119
aVTo further confirm the hypothesis that As exposure inhibits ERCC1 expression, we repeated these experimental treatments using a human lymphoblastcell line.
p7120
aVAs shown in Figure 5, As suppressed ERCC1 expression in the treated cells in a dose-responsive manner, beginningat the 0.1 \u03bcM (~ 7 \u03bcg/L) dose, with statistically significantdecreases at \u2265 1 \u03bcM (p &lt; 0.05) compared with unexposed controls.
p7121
aVWe further investigated the hypothesis that As exposure in vitro would decrease DNA repair function using the lymphoblast cell line.
p7122
aVArsenic-exposedand -unexposed cells had similar levels of baseline DNAdamage at time hr (Figure 6).
p7123
aVArsenic-exposed cells challenged with 2-AAAF for 2 hr showed significantlyhigher levels of DNA damage than did 2-AAAF\u2013challengedcells that had not been exposed to As (time = 2 hr; p &lt; 0.05; Figure 6).
p7124
aVDNA damage for both As-exposed and -unexposed, 2-AAAF\u2013challengedcells decreased during the 4-hr repair period (Figure 6).
p7125
aVNevertheless, DNA damage for As-exposed cells remained significantlyhigher than the nonexposed cells at the 6-hr time point (p &lt; 0.05; Figure 6).
p7126
aVElucidating the mechanism of As carcinogenicity has been challenging, inpart due to the dose, time, and species specificity of its biologiceffects (Barchowsky et al.
p7127
aV1999; WHO 2001).
p7128
aVOur early study (Andrew et al.
p7129
aV2003a) supported previous in vitro work showing disruption of DNA repair gene expression by As.
p7130
aVIn the presentstudy, we extended our findings to two different human populationsat the gene expression, protein, and DNA repair functional levels.
p7131
aVThus, ourdata provide both human in vivo and in vitro support for the hypothesis that As inhibits DNA repair processes (ATSDR 1999; Hartwig 1998) and that this has the potential to affect subsequent exposure to othergenotoxic and mutagenic agents.
p7132
aVThe effects of As on DNA damage and repair have been evaluated almost exclusivelyin experimental systems.
p7133
aVPrevious in vitro studies demonstrated that As specifically interferes with the repair ofDNA photolesions (Yang et al.
p7134
aV1992) and cross-linking agents (Yager and Wiencke 1993).
p7135
aVIn another study using human fibroblasts, Hartwig et al.
p7136
aV(1997) found that low (2.5 \u03bcM) concentrations of arsenite reduced nucleotideexcision repair efficiency, and incision frequency in particular, afterUVR exposure.
p7137
aVResults of additional studies in cultured humanfibroblasts indicated that As exposure reduced DNA repair capacity andspecifically inhibited the repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimer-relatedDNA damage in lymphoblastoid cells as measured by the comet assay (Curnow et al.
p7138
aV2001; Danaee et al.
p7139
aV2004; Yager and Wiencke 1993).
p7140
aVDifferences in gene expression results between these in vitro studies may be explained by differences in As dose because the effectsof As are highly dose dependent.
p7141
aVIn the present study, treatment of lymphocyteswith &gt; 1 \u03bcM sodium arsenite in vitro decreased ERCC1 gene expression.
p7142
aVThe circulating levels of As achieved in mice after intraperitoneallyadministering 0.625 nM As/kg body weight are approximatelyequivalent to the 5 \u03bcM in vitro dose and do not cause overt signs of toxicity (Soucy et al.
p7143
aV2003).
p7144
aVIn contrast, acutely toxic doses of As induced stress-response-pathwaygenes as well as ERCC1 gene expression in the livers of mice injected with 100\u2013300 \u03bcMAs/kg body weight (Liu et al.
p7145
aV2001).
p7146
aVLow concentrations of As induce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, hormonesignaling, and nuclear factor \u03baB\u2013dependent transcriptionand do not appear to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalingor other stress response pathways.
p7147
aVIn contrast, highdoses of As induce apoptosis and activate MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulatedkinase (ERK), and p-38, as well as stress-mimetic and heat-shock\u2013mimeticresponses, inhibition of proliferation, and apoptosis (Barchowsky et al.
p7148
aV1999).
p7149
aVAlthough decreased expression of ERCC1 may be partly responsible forthe decreased DNA repair function associated with As exposure, we recognizethat other pathway members may be involved, and future investigationwill be needed to elucidate all factors involved.
p7150
aVBecause otherenvironmental and genetic factors can influence DNA repair, we would notexpect complete concordance between As exposure and expression or functionon an individual level.
p7151
aVNevertheless, our in vitro studies demonstrate the effects of As within a controlled experimentalsystem.
p7152
aVFurther work is needed to identify genotypes that modify theinfluence of As exposure on DNA repair.
p7153
aVIn a human population, we previously found that drinking water As exposureat levels between 5 and 75 \u03bcg/L was associated with decreasedmRNA expression of nucleotide excision repair pathway genes in lymphocytesfrom exposed individuals (Andrew et al.
p7154
aV2003a).
p7155
aVBased on those preliminary results, we then followed up with the presentstudy, which uses a larger human population in New Hampshire.
p7156
aVInaddition to enlarging the sample size, examination of a second populationin Mexico exposed to moderate levels of As, supported our New Hampshirepopulation results.
p7157
aVAlthough we observed decreased ERCC1 expression in both populations, the difference was not statistically significantin the Mexican population.
p7158
aVThe New Hampshire study had moreextreme levels of exposure (Mexico, 5.5\u201343 \u03bcg/L; NewHampshire, 0.007\u201375 \u03bcg/L), but more likely the Mexicostudy had a smaller sample size and lacked statistical power.
p7159
aVTo our knowledge, noother studies have evaluated the association between As exposureand DNA repair gene expression or protein levels in human populations, particularlyat As levels that are in the range that is routinelyfound in the United States.
p7160
aVIn addition, our comet analysis provides functional DNA repair data inan As-exposed human population.
p7161
aVThese data support previous observationsof decreased DNA repair capacity after As exposure in vitro (Hartwig 1998).
p7162
aVArsenite has been shown to inhibit DNA repair and act as a cogenotoxinfor the direct-acting alkylating agent methyl methane-sulfonate, theindirect-acting PAH BaP, and UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in white bloodcells and fibroblasts (Curnow et al.
p7163
aV2001; Danaee et al.
p7164
aV2004; Hartmann and Speit 1996; Okui and Fujiwara 1986).
p7165
aVAs observed by Danaee et al.
p7166
aV(2004) in a previous study,
p7167
aVour in vitro As exposure appeared to inhibit the fast component of DNA repair becausethe difference is observable after challenge (Figure 6, time = 2 hr).

aVThis difference in DNA migration remained significantlyhigher in the As-exposed group after the repair period (Figure 6, time = 6 hr).
p7169
aVThus, our study and others consistently reportthat As exacerbates DNA damage induced by other mutagens.
p7170
aVWhether inorganic As can directly induce DNA damage by itself is more controversial, andprevious studies of DNA damage and mutagenesis by physiologiclevels of inorganic As have been inconsistent (Mass et al.
p7171
aV2001; Schwerdtle et al.
p7172
aV2003; Sordo et al.
p7173
aV2001; Yih and Lee 2000).
p7174
aVOur in vitro comet data did not show an increase in DNA migration after 24 hr treatmentwith 1 \u03bcM As alone (Figure 6, time = hr), but we did observe higher DNA damage levels atbaseline in cells harvested from individuals exposed to drinking waterAs at levels \u2265 13 \u03bcg/L compared to those with low levelsof As (&lt; 1 \u03bcg/L).
p7175
aVThe basis for this increase remains tobe determined; however, higher levels of DNA damage in these lymphocytesafter 2-AAAF challenge, and the slower repair kinetics of this damage, suggestthat the higher baseline levels may be a result of As-inhibitedrepair and exposure to other DNA-damaging agents.
p7176
aVIn summary, our in vitro studies of As exposure and our novel work using in vivo As exposure in two human populations support the hypothesis that As exposuredecreases DNA repair capacity.
p7177
aVFurther, our data demonstrate decreasedexpression of the nucleotide excision repair pathway member ERCC1 anddecreased repair after 2-AAAF challenge.
p7178
aVThese results supportthe theory that As can act through a cocarcinogenic mechanism of action, exacerbatingthe genotoxicity and mutagenicity of other compounds.

aVTo investigate associations among occupational exposure to coke oven emissions (COEs), oxidative stress, cytogenotoxic effects, change in the metabolizing enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), and internal levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coke oven workers,
p7180
aVwe recruited 47 male coke oven workers and 31 male control subjects from a coke oven plant in northern China.
p7181
aVWe measured the levels of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in urine, micronucleated binucleated cells (BNMNs) in peripheral blood lymphocyte, and GST in serum.
p7182
aVOur results showed that the group exposed to COEs had significantly increased levels of 1-OHP [median 5.7; interquartile range (IQR), 1.4\u201312.0 \u03bcmol/mol creatinine] compared with the control group (3; 0.5\u20136.4 \u03bcmol/mol creatinine).
p7183
aVIn addition, the median levels (IQR) of 8-OHdG, BNMNs, and GST were markedly increased in the exposed [1.9 (1.4\u201315.4) \u03bcmol/mol creatinine; 6 (2\u20138) per thousand; 22.1 (14.9\u201331.2) U/L, respectively] compared with controls [1.3 (1.0\u20134.0) \u03bcmol/mol creatinine, 2 (0\u20134) per thousand; and 13.1 (9.5\u201316.7) U/L, respectively].
p7184
aVThese results appeared to be modified by smoking.
p7185
aVHowever, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that exposure to COEs had the highest odds ratio among variables analyzed and that smoking was not a significant confounder of the levels of studied biomarkers.
p7186
aVOverall, the present findings suggest that COE exposure led to increased internal PAH burden, genetic damage, oxidative stress, and GST activity.
p7187
aVThe consequences of the changes in these biomarkers, such as risk of cancer, warrant further investigations.
p7188
aVCoke oven emissions (COEs) are formed and released into the environment when coal is pyrolyzed into coke (National Toxicology Program 2002).
p7189
aVEpidemiologic studies have shown that occupational exposure to COEs during the coking process lead to increased incidence of pulmonary and prostate cancers among coke oven workers (Costantino et al.
p7190
aV1995).
p7191
aVCOEs are complex mixtures containing a large number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 1987].
p7192
aVHence, identification of early biomarkers for occupational exposure to PAHs may lead to effective preventive measures to reduce exposure to COEs and related health effects.
p7193
aVOxygen radicals generated by environmental agents and endogenous processes may induce damage to DNA (Halliwell 1994).
p7194
aVFor instance, 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) represents an important product from oxidative damage to DNA.
p7195
aV8-OHdG is formed in a promutagenic DNA lesion induced by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with guanosine at the C8 site in DNA (Kasai et al.
p7196
aV1986).
p7197
aVOxidative stress may be implicated in aging, carcinogenesis, and other degenerative diseases, and the analysis of urinary excretion of 8-OHdG is a useful approach to assess individual cancer risk due to oxidative stress (Kasai 1997).
p7198
aVThe micronucleus (MN) assay is a widely used genotoxic assay to detect both clastogenic and aneugenic potencies of genotoxic agents or radiation (Ramalho et al.
p7199
aV1988).
p7200
aVNumerous epidemiologic studies have suggested that chromosomal alterations including formation of MNs may serve as an effective biomarker to estimate cancer risk (Hagmar et al.
p7201
aV1998).
p7202
aVIn particular, the MN assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes has been extensively used as a standard method to evaluate the presence and the extent of chromosome damage in workers occupationally exposed to genotoxic agents (Bonassi et al.
p7203
aV2001).
p7204
aVXenobiotic metabolizing enzymes play a key role in chemical carcinogenesis and are often used as biomarkers to evaluate exposure and effect of organic pollutants (van der Oost et al.

p7206
aVCertain PAHs are bifunctional inducers, which are mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor function and enhance the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Gujaeva et al.

p7208
aVGST catalyzes the conjugation of electrophilic molecules with glutathione to protect macromolecules from damage (Awasthi et al.
p7209
aV1994).
p7210
aVIn addition, GST activity has been extensively studied and used as an effective biomarker to monitor water PAH load in the tissue of aquatic organisms (Cairrao et al.
p7211
aV2004; Cheung et al.
p7212
aV2001; Tuvikene et al.
p7213
aV1999).
p7214
aVHowever, no data are available for the effect of occupational PAH exposure on the levels of serum GST activities of coke oven workers.
p7215
aVIn the present study, we investigated urinary 8-OHdG and MNs of lymphocytes from coke oven workers who were exposed to COEs.
p7216
aVIn addition, the activity of serum GST, a universal detoxifying enzyme present in the human body, was examined in these coke oven workers to explore possible modulation on GST activity by PAH exposure.
p7217
aVUrinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), a recognized biomarker of exposure to PAHs (primary constituents of COEs), was also investigated to estimate the internal burden of PAHs in this study population (Jongeneelen 2001).
p7218
aVThe study subjects were the coke oven workers in a steel plant in Taiyuan, northern China, where the workers are exposed to PAHs during the open-air coking process in their daily shift.
p7219
aVSeventy-eight male workers selected from this coke oven plant were classified into two groups, COE-exposed and control, based on historic exposure data from mandatory regular air sample analysis.
p7220
aVThe exposed group consisted of 47 coke oven workers; 31 control subjects were workers of the distillery, maintenance sections, and offices in the same plant.
p7221
aVThe workers participating in the study had been employed for at least 10 years and were currently working in the coke oven plant.
p7222
aVAfter providing their written informed consent to participate in this study, at enrollment all the individuals were interviewed; a questionnaire was used to elicit their health status, body weight and height, occupational history, smoking, and alcohol consumption.
p7223
aVThe one-time blood (2 mL each) and urine samples (20 mL each) were collected from subjects at the end of the work shift.
p7224
aVFresh blood lymphocyte cultures were carried out for the MN analysis.
p7225
aVSerum was separated by centrifugation and stored at \u221280°C for detection of GST activity.
p7226
aVThe urine samples were stored at \u221228°C before being analyzed for 1-OHP and 8-OHdG.
p7227
aVThe research protocol was approved by the Ethics and Human Subject Committee of Tongji Medical College.
p7228
aVWe determined urinary 1-OHP using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to Li et al.
p7229
aV(2003).
p7230
aVWe used 2 mL urine from each sample for the detection assay, in which 0.5 mL of sodium hydroxide (15 mol/L) was added, and the samples were incubated at 100°C for 3 hr in the dark.
p7231
aVThen, 50 \u03bcL carbazole (100 \u03bcg/mL) was added to each sample as the internal standard.
p7232
aVThe samples were adjusted to pH 3\u20135 with hydrochloric acid (1 mol/L).
p7233
aVSubsequently, 1-OHP was extracted from urine with 4 mL dichloromethane.
p7234
aVThe extracts were evaporated to dryness under vacuum before being dissolved in 0.3 mL HPLC solvent and analyzed by HPLC (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA).
p7235
aVThe separation of 1-OHP was achieved using a reverse-phase C18 column (Spherisorb ODS2, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm; Waters, Milford, MA, USA).
p7236
aVThe mobile phase used for isocratic elution of 1-OHP was composed of methanol and water (3:1).
p7237
aVTo quantify 1-OHP, we used a pump system (Varian-Prostar model 230; Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA), an autosampler (Varian-Prostar model 410), and a fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength 346 nm, emission wavelength 386 nm; Varian-Prostar model 360).
p7238
aVIdentification and quantification of 1-OHP were based on retention time and peak area measured using a linear regression curve obtained from internal standard solutions.
p7239
aVThe detection limit of urinary 1-OHP was 0.5 ng/mL; for measurements below 0.5 ng/mL, we used 0.35 ng/mL (70% of the detection limit) as the default.
p7240
aVUrine 1-OHP concentrations were expressed as micromoles per mole creatinine.
p7241
aVThe cleanup treatment of urine and analysis of urinary 8-OHdG were carried out according to a method described by Germadnik et al.
p7242
aV(1997) with minor modifications.
p7243
aVBriefly, urine samples were first centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min to remove precipitates.
p7244
aVThen, 2 mL supernatant was adsorbed twice on preconditioned cartridges (10 mL/500 mg; Bond Elut LRC C18 OH; Varian) and eluted twice with 50 mM potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4; pH 7.5) containing 15% and 20% methanol, respectively.
p7245
aVSubsequently, the eluate was evaporated to remove methanol, supplemented by HPLC solvent to bring a final volume of 1.5 mL, and analyzed by an HPLC system with electrochemical detector (Varian-Prostar model 370; Varian) equipped with a glassy-carbon working electrode operated at +0.8 V versus a silver/silver chloride reference electrode.
p7246
aVThe separation of 8-OHdG was carried out on a reverse-phase C18 column with 30°C column temperature.
p7247
aVThe mobile phase used for isocratic elution of 8-OHdG was composed of 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 3.5), 1% methanol, 2.5% acetonitrile, 2 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA.
p7248
aVThe flow rate was 0.8 mL/min, and the limit of detection of urinary 8-OHdG was 1 ng/mL.
p7249
aVWe quantified 8-OHdG in urine by the peak area of measurement using the linear regression curve for standard solutions of 3.5, 14, 56, and 224 nmol/L.
p7250
aVFor measurements below 1 ng/mL, we used 0.5 ng/mL, half of the detection limit, as the default.
p7251
aVThe concentration of urinary 8-OHdG is presented as micromoles per mole creatinine.
p7252
aVWe used a cytokinesis-block MN assay to measure lymphocytic MNs.
p7253
aVFresh blood lymphocyte cultures were set up by adding 0.5 mL whole blood to 4.5 mL RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (15%) and penicillin (100 IU/mL).
p7254
aVPhytohemagglutinin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to lymphocyte cultures at a final concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL.
p7255
aVAfter 44 hr of incubation, cytochalasin-B (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 6 \u03bcg/mL to arrest cytokinesis.
p7256
aVAfter a total incubation period of 72 hr, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min and mild hypotonic treatment in 0.075 M KCl for 2\u20133 min at room temperature.
p7257
aVThe cell suspensions were again centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min.
p7258
aVThe pellets were fixed twice in freshly prepared cold methanol/acetic acid (5:1) and dropped onto slides before staining with 10% Giemsa solution for approximately 10 min.
p7259
aVFor each sample, 1,000 binucleated cells and MNs in binucleated cells were examined, and the frequencies of BNMNs were assessed according to the criteria of Kirsch-Volders et al.
p7260
aV(2000).
p7261
aVOne reader blinded to the status of the subjects scored all slides.
p7262
aVWe measured GST activity in serum, calculated as units per liter, using a GST colorimetric activity assay kit (Jiancheng Bio Company, Nanjing, China).
p7263
aVWe performed the statistical analyses using SPSS software (version 12.0) for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
p7264
aVWe examined the normal distribution of all data using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test to determine subsequent use of appropriate tests for statistical comparison.
p7265
aVWe used Mann-Whitney and Pearson chi-square tests to compare the demographics and lifestyle variables between the exposure and control groups.
p7266
aVThe mean values of 1-OHP, 8-OHdG, BNMNs, and GST were calculated after categorizing by smoking status (smokers and nonsmokers), and the data were reported as median and interquartile range because variables were not normally distributed.
p7267
aVWe used the Mann-Whitney test to compare values of biomarkers between the exposure and control groups.
p7268
aVSpearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the relations between 1-OHP levels, GST activity, 8-OHdG concentration, and BNMN frequency.
p7269
aVWe performed multivariate logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the impact of independent variables [occupational exposure, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol drinking, and age] on dependent variables (8-OHdG, BNMNs, and GST).
p7270
aVFor all the tests, p &lt; 0.05 was defined as significant with a two-sided test.
p7271
aVTable 1 shows the characteristics of study subjects by work site.
p7272
aVCoke oven workers were 1 year older (mean age) than control subjects.
p7273
aVWe found no significant differences in employment time, BMI, or percentages of smokers and alcohol drinkers between the two groups.
p7274
aVAs shown in Table 2, we found a significant difference in urinary 1-OHP between the exposure group and the control group (p = 0.033).
p7275
aVAs an internal exposure biomarker, body PAH burden was associated with coke oven exposure.
p7276
aVLikewise, we observed that compared with the control group, coke oven workers had a significant increase of biologic effect biomarkers: 8-OHdG (p = 0.022), lymphocyte BNMN formation (p = 0.014), and serum GST activity (p &lt; 0.001).
p7277
aVFurthermore, the results appeared to be modified by smoking.
p7278
aVFor instance, statistically significant differences between the exposure group and the control group existed only in smokers for 1-OHP (p = 0.029), BNMNs (p = 0.002), and GST (p &lt; 0.001) and in nonsmokers for 8-OHdG (p = 0.005).
p7279
aVFor both exposed and control groups, no statistical differences in these biomarkers were observed between smokers and nonsmokers.
p7280
aVHowever, further multivariate analysis with adjustment for smoking was performed.
p7281
aVWe observed a significant correlation in urinary 1-OHP and serum GST activities in the total population (exposed and controls) (p = 0.005) (Table 3) and in the exposed group (p = 0.002) (Figure 1A) but not in the control group (p = 0.686) (Figure 1B).
p7282
aVHowever, we found no correlation between 1-OHP and other biomarkers, as shown in Table 3.
p7283
aVAdditionally, Table 3 presents a significant correlation between lymphocyte BNMN frequencies and serum GST activities (p = 0.009).
p7284
aVMultivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustment for age and smoking to evaluate the possible determinants of increased 8-OHdG levels, BNMN frequency, and GST activity.
p7285
aVWe calculated OR values of occupational exposure, BMI, smoking, alcohol drinking, and age to compare their contribution with the measured biomarkers.
p7286
aVAs shown in Table 4, for all three biomarkers that were significantly different between exposure and control groups, the OR values of coke oven exposure were significantly associated with 8-OHdG (OR = 4.4; 95% CI, 1.4\u201313.7), GST (OR = 13.2; 95% CI, 3.9\u201344.3), and BNMNs (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.0\u20137.4), although the association with the BNMN frequency was marginal (p = 0.047).
p7287
aVAge was associated with an increase in the risk of BNMN formation (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.0\u20137.3), but BMI was associated with a decrease in the risk of 8-OHdG adduct (OR = 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1\u20130.8).
p7288
aVCoke oven workers have a high probability of exposure to PAHs during the coking process.
p7289
aVBenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is commonly detected in PAH-containing mixtures.
p7290
aVThe concentration of B[a]P in the air on the top side of the coke oven (0.33 \u03bcg/m3)\u2014a parameter of external exposure level\u2014was almost 10 times the level in the office (0.04 \u03bcg/m3) (not shown).
p7291
aVLeng et al.
p7292
aV(2004b) demonstrated that B[a]P exposure in coke oven workers is much higher than that of the control group.
p7293
aVThe distinct B[a]P levels between coke oven workers and control subjects from offices warrants further investigation on internal exposure markers and susceptibility biomarkers.
p7294
aVThe assessment of internal exposure of coke oven workers to PAHs was based on the determination of urinary 1-OHP (Jongeneelen 2001; Leng et al.
p7295
aV2004a, 2004b).
p7296
aVBecause PAHs are normally present in cigarettes (Kim et al.
p7297
aV2003), elevated levels of 1-OHP have been confounded by smoking among workers.
p7298
aVBouchard and Viau (1999) reported a synergistic effect on excretion of 1-OHP between smoking and occupational PAH exposure.
p7299
aVIndeed, in the present study we also showed a significant increase in urinary 1-OHP in smokers but not in nonsmokers among coke oven workers compared with control subjects.
p7300
aVHowever, the significant smoking-adjusted associations suggest that the internal exposure level of PAHs was due to external exposure, including both smoking and coke oven exposure, in the workers.
p7301
aVUrinary excretion of 8-OHdG, as the repair product from oxidative DNA modification by excision enzymes, is an in vivo measure of overall oxidative DNA damage (Cooke et al.
p7302
aV2000, 2005) and has often been used as a biomarker to assess the extent of oxidative DNA damage and repair in the occupational setting (Lagorio et al.
p7303
aV1994; Pilger et al.
p7304
aV2000; Tagesson et al.
p7305
aV1993; Toraason et al.
p7306
aV2001).
p7307
aVAlthough urinary 8-OHdG levels may be affected by renal impairment (Akagi et al.
p7308
aV2003), our participants had no reported history of kidney diseases, which was further confirmed by the normal results of their routine urine analysis at the time of the study.
p7309
aVIn the present study, the level of urinary 8-OHdG was much higher in coke oven workers than in control subjects.
p7310
aVAlthough elevated 8-OHdG levels existed only in nonsmokers and not in smokers of the exposure group, further multivariate logistic regression analysis suggests that occupational exposure to COEs was associated with an increase but BMI was associated with a decrease in the levels of 8-OHdG after adjustment for age and smoking.
p7311
aVBMI showed a significant effect on 8-OHdG excretions, which may be due to higher rate of metabolism in lean subjects with increased availability of reactive oxygen species (Loft et al.
p7312
aV1992).
p7313
aVIt is important to investigate the effect of occupational exposure to COEs on genotoxicity in coke oven workers.
p7314
aVThere was a significant increased frequency of BNMNs in smokers but not in nonsmokers among coke oven workers, when compared with control subjects.
p7315
aVThe multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both occupational exposure to COEs and age were risk factors of formation of MNs in the workers we studied.
p7316
aVThe same levels of association of occupational exposure and age with the MN formation suggest that they were equally important risk factors.
p7317
aVThe present finding implies that age as a time-dependent variable should be carefully considered and controlled in similar epidemiologic studies of environmental exposure using MNs as a biomarker.
p7318
aVAs an important detoxification enzyme, GST plays a major role in protecting individuals from PAH-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis (Nakajima et al.
p7319
aV1995).
p7320
aVIn the present study, serum GST activity in coke oven workers was much higher than that of controls.
p7321
aVBecause GST serves as a phase II enzyme in detoxifying xenobiotics and keeping intracellular redox balance in the presence of its substrates, the increase of GST activity in coke oven workers may represent adaptation or defense against the burden of mutagens and carcinogens in the human body.
p7322
aVOccupational exposure is a significant risk factor revealed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
p7323
aVHowever, the other two factors we studied, aging and smoking, were not significant.
p7324
aVFurthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between GST activity and PAH exposure based on urinary 1-OHP levels.
p7325
aVAdditionally, correlation analysis also revealed a significant positive correlation between GST and BNMNs, indicating coherence of toxicity response to PAH exposure.
p7326
aVIt is widely recognized that GST polymorphisms potentially contribute to individual susceptibility to carcinogen-induced biomarkers of exposure and effect (Wormhoudt et al.
p7327
aV1999).
p7328
aVIndeed, Leng et al.
p7329
aV(2004b) demonstrated that the frequency of MNs was lower in coke oven workers with a nonnull glutathione S-transferase mu-1 (GSTM1) genotype than in those with the null GSTM1 genotype in a steel company in northeastern China.
p7330
aVHence, influence on MN formation by GST polymorphism should be taken into account in future studies.
p7331
aVTaken together, GST should be considered a possible indicator for monitoring PAH exposure.
p7332
aVTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to estimate the relationship between individual serum GST activity and occupational exposure to PAHs.
p7333
aVAs for the correlations among 1-OHP, 8-OHdG, BNMNs, and GST, the 1-OHP concentrations were not significantly correlated with 8-OHdG levels or BNMN frequency in all subjects, suggesting that these markers may have different specificities.
p7334
aVIt is well known that in, addition to PAHs, COEs also contain a variety of nitrosamines, coal tar, metals compounds, and so forth.
p7335
aVThese cocontaminants derived from COEs may also contribute to the levels of urinary 8-OHdG and lymphocytic MNs (Kim et al.
p7336
aV2004; Palus et al.
p7337
aV2003).
p7338
aVIn summary, we simultaneously investigated levels of PAH exposure, cytogenetic damage, oxidative stress, and enzyme activity change induced in workers exposed to COEs.
p7339
aVOur data suggest that urinary 1-OHP and serum GST might be regarded as biomarkers of PAH exposure and that urinary 8-OHdG and lymphocytic MNs could be used as parameters to reflect occupational health effects in coke oven workers.
p7340
aVHowever, confounding factors, such as BMI and age, may influence the assessment of biologic effects of occupational COE exposure.
p7341
aVOverall, the present study provides some new clues in developing biomarkers in biomonitoring and early prevention of health effects associated with occupational exposure to COEs, including genotoxicity burden and subsequent cancer risk.
p7342
aVArsenic, chromium, and nickel are reported in several epidemiologic studies to be associated with lung cancer.
p7343
aVHowever, the health effects of arsenic, chromium, and nickel exposures are equivocal for children.
p7344
aVTherefore, we performed a cross-sectional study to investigate possible associations between the internal concentrations of arsenic, chromium, and nickel and the level of oxidative stress to DNA in children.
p7345
aVWe measured urinary levels of arsenic, chromium, and nickel for 142 nonsmoking children using atomic absorption spectrometry.
p7346
aVAs a biomarker for oxidative stress, urinary 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were analyzed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.
p7347
aVThe median urinary 8-OHdG level for our subjects was 11.7 ng/mg creatinine.
p7348
aVNo obvious relationship between the levels of urinary nickel and 8-OHdG was found.
p7349
aVMultiple linear regression analysis showed that children with higher urinary chromium had greater urinary 8-OHdG than did those with lower urinary chromium.
p7350
aVSimilarly, subjects with higher urinary arsenic had greater urinary 8-OHdG than did those with lower urinary arsenic.
p7351
aVFurthermore, children with both high urinary arsenic and high urinary chromium had the highest 8-OHdG levels (mean ± SE, 16.0 ± 1.3; vs. low arsenic/low chromium, p &lt; 0.01) in urine, followed by those with low arsenic/high chromium (13.7 ± 1.6; vs. low arsenic/low chromium, p = 0.25), high arsenic/low chromium (12.9 ± 1.6 vs. low arsenic/low chromium, p = 0.52), and low arsenic/low chromium (11.5 ± 1.3); the trend was significant (p &lt; 0.001).
p7352
aVThus, environmental carcinogenic metal exposure to chromium and arsenic may play an important role in oxidative DNA damage to children.
p7353
aVPotential hazardous pollutants from industrial sources such as thermal power plants are often emitted to our living environments, where they possibly expose adults and children to heavy metals through inhalation and ingestion of contaminated soil and dust.
p7354
aVEarlier literature pointed out that increased use of coal for power production will lead to increased release of metals into the environment (Sabbioni et al.
p7355
aV1984).
p7356
aVFurthermore, high quantities of arsenic, chromium, and nickel are detected in milled coal and ash of coal-fired power plants (Goodarzi and Huggins 2001), and these three metals are also reportedly associated with human lung cancers in several occupational epidemiologic studies (Chen and Chen 2002; Droste et al.
p7357
aV1999; Grimsrud et al.
p7358
aV2002).
p7359
aVHowever, the health effects of arsenic, chromium, and nickel exposure are especially equivocal for children.
p7360
aVChildren are considered to be a population susceptible to adverse health effects induced by air pollutants (Nicolai 1999).
p7361
aVPrevious studies of metal exposure to children in Taiwan focused primarily on lead in occupational sites (Wang et al.
p7362
aV2002) and Chinese herbal medicine (Cheng et al.
p7363
aV1998), whereas effects of other environmental contaminants such as arsenic, chromium, and nickel on children\u2019s health have been largely ignored.
p7364
aVThe carcinogenic potential of arsenic, chromium, and nickel compounds is well established for humans and experimental animals (Hayes 1997).
p7365
aVHowever, the molecular damage formation after exposure to metals is still not well understood.
p7366
aVOne mechanism proposed frequently is an increase in oxidative DNA lesions attributable to metal exposure, mediated by increased generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Dally and Hartwig 1997; Kasprzak 1991; Kasprzak et al.
p7367
aV1997).
p7368
aVOxidative DNA lesions are supposed to play important roles in various diseases including cancer and premature aging (Beckman and Ames 1998; Cerutti 1994; Grisham 1994; Jenner 1994; Witztum 1994).
p7369
aVAmong the diverse oxidative DNA lesions, 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is one of the most abundant base modifications and has attracted special attention because it is premutagenic, causing G-to-T transversions (Cheng et al.
p7370
aV1992); thus, the presence of 8-OHdG may lead to mutagenesis.
p7371
aVMoreover, the repair process for 8-OHdG\u2013inflicted damage results in excised 8-OHdG adduct being excreted into the urine (Marnett 2000; Shigenaga et al.
p7372
aV1989).
p7373
aVBecause of easy collection, urinary 8-OHdG is thus regarded as a suitable biomarker of oxidative stress (Toraason 1999; Wong et al.
p7374
aV2003).
p7375
aVTo investigate possible associations between the incorporated internal concentrations of arsenic, chromium, and nickel and the level of oxidative stress in schoolchildren,
p7376
aVwe performed a cross-sectional study in Taiwan.
p7377
aVThe study subjects were nonsmoking fifth-grade pupils (10\u201312 years of age) who in January 2003 were attending three elementary schools from three different towns of Taichung County, Taiwan.
p7378
aVEach selected primary school was close to, and within 1 km of, an ambient air quality monitoring station.
p7379
aVOf these schools, Longgang elementary school is also adjacent to the Taichung Thermal Power Plant on the southern side of Taichung harbor, with eight coal-fired generation units in operation to accommodate a total installed capacity of 4,688 MW.
p7380
aVThe coal consumption of this power plant is approximately 1.28 million tons per year.
p7381
aVCoal is stored at and delivered from three coal yards (storage capacity, 310, 0.52, and 0.42 million tons, respectively) near the power plant.
p7382
aVThus, it is possible that coal particles are emitted into the atmosphere from these three coal yards.
p7383
aVAdditionally, there were no major roads or factories within the Longgang elementary school district.
p7384
aVThe remaining schools, Shalach and Shuntian, are located in suburban communities and are on the northeastern upwind side approximately 8 and 18 km of the Taichung Thermal Power Plant, respectively.
p7385
aVIn addition, these two school districts are intersected by major trunk roads.
p7386
aVAll subjects who participated in the medical surveillance process underwent physical examinations conducted by a qualified pediatrician.
p7387
aVAll participating schoolchildren voluntarily entered the study after informed written consent was obtained from the children\u2019s parents.
p7388
aVParents of schoolchildren completed the questionnaire before collecting children\u2019s urine samples.
p7389
aVThe questionnaire was divided into the following parts: demographic data of the children, respiratory symptoms and diseases of the children, smoking habits and occupation of the parents, and possible sources of indoor air pollution such as household smoking, pet feeding, incense burning all day, and home dampness.
p7390
aVAccording to the responses to the questionnaires, asthma was assessed by the question \u201chas your child had wheezing in the chest accompanied by dyspnea that had ever been given the diagnosis of asthma by a physician during the past 12 months?\u201d Similarly, children who had been diagnosed as having allergic rhinitis by a physician were considered to have a history of allergic rhinitis.
p7391
aVOf these study subjects, 16 schoolchildren were excluded from the study because of incomplete urine samples or residence far from the school.
p7392
aVFinally, a total of 142 subjects without any disease history except respiratory diseases participated in this study.
p7393
aVIn our study period, spot morning urine samples were collected in polypropylene specimen containers.
p7394
aVThe decision to use first morning voids rather than 24-hr collections was based on the report by Thompson et al.
p7395
aV(1999), which indicated that 24-hr average urinary levels were not statistically different in values from first voids.
p7396
aVMoreover, it is difficult to collect 24-hr urine samples and first voids of morning urine from every subject.
p7397
aVFinally, most morning urine specimens we obtained were first spot and small numbers of them were second spot specimens.
p7398
aVImmediately after the collection, urine samples were stored at \u221220°C until used for analysis.
p7399
aVMetal levels in urine samples including arsenic, chromium, and nickel were measured using atomic absorption spectrometry with a graphite furnace (model 4110ZL; Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) technique and Zeeman background correction.
p7400
aVAll analytical glassware and plasticware purchased were of low-metal grade and were further cleaned with diluted nitric acid before use.
p7401
aVInitially, all the frozen samples were thawed and aliquotted at room temperature.
p7402
aVA solution of Triton X-100 (0.1%, wt/vol) was prepared in nitric acid (0.2%, vol/vol).
p7403
aVSubsequently, the 18-mL urine samples were diluted with 2 mL of prepared Triton X-100 solution (9:1) and stored at \u221220°C until required for analysis.
p7404
aVUrine test portion and aqueous standards were injected at 20 \u03bcL using the autosamplers in the furnace.
p7405
aVWe used a mixture containing palladium plus magnesium nitrate, and magnesium nitrate as chemical modifiers for the determination of arsenic and chromium in urine, respectively.
p7406
aVNo matrix modifier was used for the determination of nickel.
p7407
aVFor analyses of urinary metals, we checked the accuracy of the instrumental methods and the analytical procedure by using reference solutions (standard reference material 12111, normal-range metals urine toxicology control; UTAK Laboratories, Valencia, CA, USA), which were run before every batch of samples.
p7408
aVThe correlation coefficients for each of the values of the standard curves were all &gt; 0.990.
p7409
aVThe mean recovery rates ranged from 90 to 105%, and coefficients of variation for reproducibility were all &lt; 10%.
p7410
aVMetal concentrations in urine were corrected for each individual according to their urinary creatinine values, and urinary samples were analyzed blind to the status of the individuals for the presence of metals.
p7411
aVBefore examination, urine samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min to remove any suspended cell debris.
p7412
aVThe supernatants were used for the determination of 8-OHdG levels using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA; Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Fukuroi, Japan).
p7413
aVThe determination range was 0.5\u2013200 ng/mL.
p7414
aVThe 8-OHdG monoclonal antibody N45.1 and urine sample were loaded at 50 \u03bcL onto a microtiter plate that was coated with 8-OHdG, and incubated at 37°C for 60 min, in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.
p7415
aVAfter the wells were washed three times, the antibodies that remained bound to the 8-OHdG in the sample were further bound with the horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibody, followed by incubation at 37°C for 60 min.
p7416
aVThe wells were again washed three times.
p7417
aVSubsequently, a substrate containing 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine was added, and the wells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, resulting in the development of color intensity proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the plate.
p7418
aVThe color reaction was terminated by the addition of stop solution (1 M phosphoric acid), and the absorbance was measured using a computer-controlled spectrophotometric plate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm.
p7419
aVThe concentration of 8-OHdG in the test samples was interpolated from a standard curve drawn with the assistance of logarithmic transformation.
p7420
aVUrinary 8-OHdG levels were subsequently adjusted by urinary creatinine levels.
p7421
aVBecause of the positively skewed distribution of the urinary arsenic, chromium, and nickel levels, we used nonparametric testing to test the differences of urinary metal levels among our study children at three different elementary schools.
p7422
aVSimilarly, because of the positively skewed distribution of the urinary 8-OHdG levels, we used nonparametric testing to test the differences of urinary 8-OHdG level for each variable.
p7423
aVMedian values of urinary arsenic, chromium, and nickel levels were used as cutoff.
p7424
aVSubsequently, we developed a multiple linear regression analysis to adjust for significant covariate identified in the univariate analysis to evaluate potential differences in urinary 8-OHdG.
p7425
aVWe also computed regression coefficients and their SEs and calculated least-square means to predict the adjusted 8-OHdG levels for children with different urinary metal contents.
p7426
aVIn total, 142 children (74 boys and 68 girls) were involved in this study.
p7427
aVTheir ages ranged from 10 to 12 years (mean age, 11.2 years).
p7428
aVAll study subjects lived within the limits of the Taichung harbor area and lived near their schools.
p7429
aVMore than half of the parents of study subjects had achieved greater than a senior high school education (58.5% for fathers, 51.4% for mothers).
p7430
aVAlmost half (49.3%) the parents were smokers.
p7431
aVHalf the parents were industrial workers.
p7432
aVPossible sources of indoor air pollution such as pet feeding were reported in 19.0% of children\u2019s homes, incense burning all day was reported in 40.8% of homes, and home dampness was reported in 20.4% of homes.
p7433
aVIn addition, prevalences of asthma and allergic rhinitis among study participants were 7.0 and 31.0%, respectively.
p7434
aVThe median urinary metal levels were 6.4 \u03bcg/L for arsenic, 1.9 \u03bcg/L for chromium, and 3.4 \u03bcg/L for nickel (Table 1).
p7435
aVThe creatinine-adjusted median levels were 7.7 \u03bcg/g for arsenic, 2.0 \u03bcg/g for chromium, and 4.1 \u03bcg/g for nickel.
p7436
aVAmong the 142 urine samples, 19 urine samples were below the detection limit of 0.1 \u03bcg/L urine for arsenic, 19 samples were below the detection limit of 0.7 \u03bcg/L for chromium, and 16 samples were below the detection limit of 0.8 \u03bcg/L for nickel.
p7437
aVEspecially, the study children at Longgang elementary school had significantly higher urinary levels of arsenic, chromium, and nickel than did those at Shalach and Shuntian elementary schools (p-values \u2264 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test).
p7438
aVMedian urinary 8-OHdG level for the study subjects was 11.7 ng/mg creatinine (range, 0.4\u201359.7 ng/mg creatinine) (Table 2).
p7439
aVChildren at Longgang elementary school had higher 8-OHdG levels than did those at Shalach and Shuntian elementary schools (p &lt; 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test).
p7440
aVChildren of mothers who had greater than a senior high school education had significantly lower 8-OHdG levels than did children of mothers who had less than a senior high school education (p = 0.04, Wilcoxon rank sum test).
p7441
aVChildren whose parents smoked at home also had significantly higher 8-OHdG levels than did children whose parents did not smoke at home (p = 0.07).
p7442
aVChildren with allergic rhinitis had significantly lower 8-OHdG levels than did those without allergic rhinitis (p = 0.02).
p7443
aVHowever, sex (p = 0.94), paternal education (p = 0.70), parental occupation (p = 0.11), pet feeding (p = 0.92), incense burning at home all day (p = 0.18), home dampness (p = 0.40), and asthma history (p = 0.51) were not associated with increased urinary 8-OHdG levels.
p7444
aVChildren with urinary arsenic levels &gt; 7.7 \u03bcg/g creatinine (median, n = 71) had higher 8-OHdG levels than did those with urinary arsenic levels &lt; 7.7 \u03bcg/g creatinine (n = 71, p = 0.09).
p7445
aVChildren with urinary chromium &gt; 2.2 \u03bcg/g creatinine (median, n = 71) also had higher 8-OHdG levels than did those with urinary chromium levels &lt; 2.2 \u03bcg/g creatinine (n = 71, p = 0.06).
p7446
aVHowever, children with urinary nickel levels &gt; 4.1 \u03bcg/g creatinine (median, n = 71) did not have higher 8-OHdG levels than those with urinary nickel levels &lt; 4.1 \u03bcg/g creatinine (n = 71, p = 0.62).
p7447
aVOur univariate analysis showed that only elementary school, maternal education, parental smoking status, history of allergic rhinitis, and urinary creatinine-adjusted concentrations of arsenic and chromium were obviously associated with elevated levels of urinary 8-OHdG (p-values &lt; 0.10).
p7448
aVTherefore, we performed a multiple linear regression model for urinary 8-OHdG level as a function of maternal education, parental smoking status, history of allergic rhinitis, and urinary creatinine-adjusted concentrations of arsenic and chromium [general linear model (GLM); Table 3].
p7449
aVWe excluded elementary school in this model because the variables of elementary school and urinary arsenic and chromium levels had high colinearity.
p7450
aVUrinary 8-OHdG level was positively associated with maternal educational level below senior high school (p = 0.05) and was negatively associated with history of allergic rhinitis (p = 0.05).
p7451
aVHowever, parental smoking status (p = 0.47) appeared not to influence the concentrations of urinary 8-OHdG for individuals when examining the data using GLM analysis.
p7452
aVInterestingly, a mean difference of 1.9 ng/mg creatinine for urinary 8-OHdG was noted for children with high urinary arsenic levels compared with those with low urinary arsenic levels (p = 0.18).
p7453
aVChildren with high urinary chromium levels also had a mean difference of 3.0 ng/mg creatinine for urinary 8-OHdG compared with those with low urinary chromium levels (p = 0.04).
p7454
aVFurthermore, in this model, the partial R2 value was 17.5% for urinary arsenic and 21.5% for urinary chromium.
p7455
aVSubsequently, we performed a least-squares mean analysis to assess the urinary 8-OHdG levels of children with combination of urinary arsenic and chromium adjusted for maternal education and history of allergic rhinitis.
p7456
aVChildren with both low urinary arsenic and low urinary chromium levels had the lowest urinary 8-OHdG mean levels of 11.4 ng/mg creatinine (n = 44; Figure 1), whereas those with both high urinary arsenic and high urinary chromium levels had the highest urinary 8-OHdG mean levels of 16.2 ng/mg creatinine (n = 43; vs. low arsenic/low chromium, p &lt; 0.01).
p7457
aVThose with both low urinary arsenic and high urinary chromium levels (13.7 ng/mg creatinine, n = 28; vs. low arsenic/low chromium, p = 0.25) and those with both high urinary arsenic and low urinary chromium levels (12.7 ng/mg creatinine, n = 27; vs. low arsenic/low chromium, p = 0.52) had a moderately increased 8-OHdG mean levels.
p7458
aVThis trend in urinary 8-OHdG levels was statistically significant (p = 0.01, GLM).
p7459
aVFurthermore, the difference in urinary 8-OHdG levels between the combination high urinary arsenic and chromium and combination low urinary arsenic and chromium (4.8 ng/mg creatinine) was greater than the summation of differences of urinary 8-OHdG levels between the combination low urinary arsenic and high urinary chromium and combination low urinary arsenic and low urinary chromium (2.3 ng/mg creatinine), and combined high urinary arsenic and low urinary chromium with combined low urinary arsenic and low urinary chromium (1.3 ng/mg creatinine).
p7460
aVAttacks on DNA by ROS frequently result in oxidative DNA damage.
p7461
aV8-OHdG is a modified base that occurs in DNA because of attack by hydroxyl radicals.
p7462
aVBecause it is premutagenic, causing G-to-T transversions (Cheng et al.
p7463
aV1992), the presence of 8-OHdG may lead to mutagenesis.
p7464
aVThe possibility of 8-OHdG arising from oxidation of deoxyguanosine has been also proposed (Shigenaga et al.
p7465
aV1989), and the result of this deoxyguanosine oxidation does not occur in DNA, so this 8-OHdG has no mutagenic potential.
p7466
aVThus, urinary 8-OHdG is commonly considered a biomarker of oxidative stress, reflecting its repair from DNA.
p7467
aVNonetheless, urinary 8-OHdG has not been used in previous studies to detect the effects of environmental carcinogenic metal exposure in children.
p7468
aVIn our study, the median value (11.7 ng/mg creatinine) of urinary 8-OHdG for our participants was similar to that of a previous study for normal English children (10.0 ng/mg creatinine) (Drury et al.
p7469
aV1998).
p7470
aVA major fraction of arsenic, chromium, and nickel absorbed by humans appears to be eliminated relatively quickly and mainly via urine.
p7471
aVThe biologic half-life for these metals has been estimated to be between 1 and 3 days (Hwang et al.
p7472
aV1997; Paustenbach et al.
p7473
aV1997; Sunderman 1993; Vahter 1994).
p7474
aVThus, these metal concentrations in urine samples are determined as important short-term exposure biomarkers and have been used in many epidemiologic studies (Moore et al.
p7475
aV1997; Smith-Sivertsen et al.
p7476
aV1998; Stern et al.
p7477
aV1998).
p7478
aVIn the present study, we found statistically significant relationships between the urinary concentrations of chromium and arsenic and the level of DNA oxidative stress.
p7479
aVThe lack of correlation between exposure to nickel and DNA oxidative stress could be attributable to a low biologically relevant dose in the study population.
p7480
aVSeveral studies have demonstrated that arsenic and chromium cause oxidative DNA damage to cultured cells (Kessel et al.
p7481
aV2002; Yuann et al.
p7482
aV1999).
p7483
aVPrevious epidemiologic studies have also shown increased 8-OHdG levels in humans exposed to arsenic (Matsui et al.
p7484
aV1999) or chromium (Kuo et al.
p7485
aV2003).
p7486
aVTransition metals are commonly thought to produce ROS such as hydroxyl radicals that can directly damage cellular DNA.
p7487
aVThe other mechanism is indirect oxidative DNA damage due to inflammation caused by metal exposure (Donaldson et al.
p7488
aV2002).
p7489
aVSome metals may stimulate the defense systems of the body so that they react against the toxic damage to produce cytokines (Carter et al.
p7490
aV1997; Donaldson et al.
p7491
aV2002).
p7492
aVSeveral cytokines cause production of large amounts of ROS.
p7493
aVSome propose that ROS generated in inflamed tissues can cause injury to target cells and also damage DNA, which contributes to carcinogenic processes (Chazotte-Aubert et al.
p7494
aV1999; Eiserich et al.
p7495
aV1998).
p7496
aVEnvironmentally relevant metals seldom occur alone.
p7497
aVLittle is known about the exact mechanism of carcinogenesis of two or more metals when they are present together.
p7498
aVIt is generally assumed that the concept of additivity is operative on low-level exposures to chemical mixtures (Hartwig and Schwerdtle 2002).
p7499
aVIt is particularly interesting that we observed a synergistic effect for combined arsenic and chromium exposure on DNA oxidative stress in the present study (Figure 1).
p7500
aVIt may be that other types of cellular damage are caused by metal exposure, which also contributes to their carcinogenic potentials.
p7501
aVThere is accumulating evidence that metals including arsenic and chromium can interfere with distinct steps of diverse DNA repair systems (Hartwig and Schwerdtle 2002).
p7502
aVThus, oxidative DNA lesions are not only induced by metals at biologically relevant concentrations, but their extent may also be enhanced indirectly by impaired repair.
p7503
aVFurther studies are required to clarify these findings.
p7504
aVThe amount of the modified base in cellular DNA excreted into urine should represent the average rate of DNA damage in the whole body (Cooke et al.
p7505
aV2000).
p7506
aVThus, it is possible that the levels of oxidative DNA damage are reflective of different active diseases, especially active inflammation (Wong et al.
p7507
aV2003).
p7508
aVBesides, urinary levels of any oxidative lesion rely on efficient renal excretion of the damage products, so renal impairment can therefore affect urinary 8-OHdG levels (Akagi et al.
p7509
aV2003).
p7510
aVIn our study, urinary creatinine levels were used to correct for variation in urine concentration.
p7511
aVIn addition, no medical histories were reported by our participants except asthma and allergic rhinitis.
p7512
aVThere is ample evidence indicating that allergic disorders, such as asthma and rhinitis, are mediated by oxidative stress (Bowler and Crapo 2002).
p7513
aVIn our study, we did not observe a significant association between asthma and urinary 8-OHdG level in children.
p7514
aVOn the contrary, children with allergic rhinitis had significantly lower 8-OHdG than did those without.
p7515
aVOne could interpret this finding as an effect rather than a cause; that is, children with past allergies or past episodes of respiratory symptoms have had previous medical care, and their parents may have been urged to improve their environment to alleviate the symptoms.
p7516
aVWe also found that maternal education level, used as a proxy for socioeconomic status, was significantly related to children\u2019s oxidative DNA damage.
p7517
aVMaternal education may convey information that influences the patterns of potential metal exposure as well as health care for children.
p7518
aVIn addition, we also observed that children whose parents smoked had higher 8-OHdG expression, although it was not significant in our multiple linear regression model.
p7519
aVBecause cigarette smoke contains ROS, the association between cigarette smoking and urinary 8-OHdG has been previously reported (Loft and Poulsen 1996).
p7520
aVHowever, the association between 8-OHdG and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke has not been investigated.
p7521
aVOxidative damage occurs rapidly after exposure, and this damage can be repaired rapidly.
p7522
aVBecause Taiwanese children may not have regular chances to be exposed to tobacco smoke from their family members, the effects of passive smoking on 8-OHdG in children are less likely to appear in the model.
p7523
aVChildren spend their most of their time indoors.
p7524
aVIt is therefore important to consider the effects that exposure to indoor air pollutants may have on children\u2019s oxidative DNA damage.
p7525
aVHouse dust and fungi are the major indoor pollutants in our subtropical area (Li et al.
p7526
aV1994; Wang et al.
p7527
aV1999).
p7528
aVIn addition, burning Chinese incense releases polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Lung et al.
p7529
aV2003), which may increase cellular oxidative stress (Wu et al.
p7530
aV2003).
p7531
aVOur data provide no evidence for an association between the levels of indoor environmental factors such as pet feeding, incense burning, and home dampness.
p7532
aVIn our study, these indicators were self-reported and therefore were subjective and could have resulted in misclassification of exposure that might reduce the observed associations.
p7533
aVWhen the balance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant processes is shifted in favor of the former, increased 8-OHdG would be generated from further DNA oxidation and ring opening followed by rearrangements (Cadet et al.
p7534
aV2003).
p7535
aVHowever, the role of pro-oxidant and antioxidant on 8-OHdG in our study children was not identified.
p7536
aVIn addition, the 8-OHdG monoclonal antibody used in our ELISA assay has similar binding affinity for the oxidized free base 8-hydroxyguanine, and the oxidized nucleoside 8-hydroxyguanosine (Yin et al.
p7537
aV1995).
p7538
aVThus, the possibility of overestimation of urinary 8-OHdG levels by our ELISA assay cannot be ruled out, and this bias would be likely to attenuate the observed association if it was nondifferential.
p7539
aVIn our study, children\u2019s exposure to arsenic and chromium was associated with increased generation of subsequent 8-OHdG.
p7540
aVHowever, the role of other carcinogenic metals on oxidative DNA damage also requires further study.
p7541
aVFor the future, a longitudinal rather than a cross-sectional study should be conducted to ascertain the possible association between carcinogenic metal exposure and oxidative DNA lesions.
p7542
aVA longitudinal study that includes a relevant number of environmentally exposed participants offers an advantage for studying dose\u2013effect relationships over time with repeated measurements.
p7543
aVA 52-year-old male chemical worker was admitted to the hospital with a history of paroxysmal microscopic hematuria for about 2 years and nocturia with gross hematuria about five times per night for 2 months.

aVUrinary MBOCA levels (267.9\u201315701.1 \u03bcg/g creatinine) far exceeded the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s reference value of 100 \u03bcg/L.
p7552
aVThis patient worked in the purification process with occupational exposure to MBOCA for 14 years.
p7553
aVAccording to the environmental and biologic monitoring data and latency period, and excluding other potential bladder carcinogen exposure, this worker was diagnosed as having occupational bladder cancer due to high exposure to MBOCA through inhalation or dermal absorption in the purification area.
p7554
aVThis case finding supports that MBOCA is a potential human carcinogen.
p7555
aVSafe use of skin-protective equipment and respirators is required to prevent workers from MBOCA exposure.
p7556
aVIncidence and mortality rates of bladder cancer vary about 10-fold worldwide.
p7557
aVThe highest rates are found in North America and Europe, and the rates are low in many parts of Asia (Engel et al.
p7558
aV2002).
p7559
aVIn Taiwan, the incidence and mortality rates of bladder cancer (per 100,000) in 2000 were 8.93 and 3.00 for males and 3.87 and 1.36 for females, respectively [Taiwan Department of Health (DOH) 2004].
p7560
aVTransitional cell carcinomas account for about 95% of bladder neoplasms.
p7561
aVThe remaining 5% consist of squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and others (Engel et al.
p7562
aV2002).
p7563
aVCigarette smoking and occupational exposures are well-documented risk factors for bladder cancer.
p7564
aVOther known or suspected risk factors for bladder cancer include race, sex, age, lifestyle, chlorination by-products and arsenic in drinking water, ionizing radiation, bladder infection, high consumption of phenacetin-containing analgesics, and hair dyes (Engel et al.
p7565
aV2002).
p7566
aVSeveral genetic susceptibility factors have been found to be related to bladder cancer (Engel et al.
p7567
aV2002).
p7568
aVBladder cancer is associated with a number of occupational exposures.
p7569
aVThe first such association was observed in 1895 (Rehn 1895), and subsequent research among dyestuff workers identified the aromatic amines benzidine and 2-naphthylamine as bladder carcinogens (Case et al.
p7570
aV1954).
p7571
aVSeveral other aromatic amines and related compounds have also been identified as suspected human bladder carcinogens, including 1-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl, 4-chloro-o-toluidine, o-toluidine, and 4,4\u2032-methylenedianiline [Engel et al.
p7572
aV2002; International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 1987].
p7573
aVExcess risk of bladder cancer has also been observed among rubber workers; painters; truck, bus, and taxi drivers; aluminum workers; and leather workers (Engel et al.
p7574
aV2002).
p7575
aVIt has been estimated that these occupational exposures are responsible for 18% of bladder cancer cases.
p7576
aVAs little as 2 years\u2019 exposure may be sufficient to increase the risk, but the time between exposure and subsequent cancer may be as long as 45 years (Goroll et al.
p7577
aV2000).
p7578
aV4,4\u2032-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA) is used as a curing agent in industries that primarily produce castable polyurethane parts; thus, occupational exposure may occur during the manufacturing processes in these industries [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 1994].
p7579
aVWorkers may inhale MBOCA in small particles in the air or absorb it through the skin during contact with MBOCA dust or vapor.
p7580
aVAcute exposure to high levels of MBOCA may cause eye and skin irritation in humans (Hosein and Van Roosmalen 1978).
p7581
aVIntermediate and chronic exposure to MBOCA may lead to tumors of the urinary bladder (ATSDR 1994; Kommineni et al.
p7582
aV1979; Russfield et al.
p7583
aV1975; Stula et al.
p7584
aV1975, 1978 ).
p7585
aVIn a U.S. retrospective bladder cancer incidence study, 385 of 532 workers ever exposed to MBOCA from 1968 to 1979 and 20 workers who were first employed in 1980 and 1981 participated in a urine screening test (Ward et al.
p7586
aV1990).
p7587
aVWorkers were exposed to MBOCA for a median employment period of 3.2 months (between 1968 and 1981).
p7588
aVCystoscopy revealed a papillary cell tumor in one worker, and low-grade papillary transitional cell tumors of the urinary bladder were diagnosed in 2 of the remaining 200 workers examined by cystoscopy (Ward et al.
p7589
aV1990).
p7590
aVThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has determined that MBOCA may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen (ATSDR 1994).
p7591
aVIARC has determined that MBOCA is probably carcinogenic to humans (category 2A; IARC 1993).
p7592
aVThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has determined that MBOCA is a probable human carcinogen (category 2A; ATSDR 1994).
p7593
aVIn the Report on Carcinogens, Eleventh Edition [National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2005], the NTP reported that MBOCA may reasonably be anticipated to be a human carcinogen.
p7594
aVIn this article we report a sentinel case of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder diagnosed in an MBOCA-manufacturing factory in Taiwan.
p7595
aVA 52-year-old male chemical worker was admitted to the hospital with a history of paroxysmal microscopic hematuria for about 2 years and nocturia with gross hematuria about five times per night for 2 months.
p7596
aVHe was a nonsmoker and denied taking any medication.
p7597
aVHe did not use hair dye or reside in an area with endemic blackfoot disease (arsenic intoxication).
p7598
aVSocial alcohol drinking was noted.
p7599
aVMicroscopic hematuria was noted in the periodic health examinations for about 2 years, but the patient ignored it.
p7600
aVTwo months before admission, he developed nocturia about five times per night.
p7601
aVParoxysmal painless hematuria was also noted.
p7602
aVGross hematuria accompanied by lower abdominal distress occurred 2 weeks before admission.
p7603
aVHis body weight had decreased from 75 kg to 72 kg over the previous 3 months.
p7604
aVHe visited the hospital, and an intravenous urogram (IVU) showed a mass occupying half of the bladder capacity.
p7605
aVCystoscopy revealed a mass over the left dome area of the bladder.
p7606
aVCystoscopic biopsy specimens revealed a grade 3/3 invasive transitional cell carcinoma with marked necrosis.
p7607
aVRadical cystectomy with ileal conduit combined with radiotherapy was performed because the bladder tissue showed lymphovascular permeation with lymph node metastasis.
p7608
aVThe worker is still on medical leave because of disease.
p7609
aVThe manufacturing of MBOCA includes the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and packing processes.
p7610
aVBriefly, o-chloroaniline is reacted with sulfuric acid and formaldehyde under the catalyst of stannous chloride for 3\u20134 hr.
p7611
aVThe MBOCA products are then neutralized with an alkali, sodium hydroxide, at a high temperature.
p7612
aVAfter washing and purification, the solid MBOCA is cut into pellets.
p7613
aVAlthough most of the processes are done in closed systems and are automatic, leakage of products from pipes and tanks has been reported.
p7614
aVThe work schedule in the factory where our patient worked has three 8-hr shifts, and three or four workers in each shift are assigned to each manufacturing line.
p7615
aVThe patient was a farmer until he began working at this factory.
p7616
aVHe worked in the purification area of this MBOCA-producing company for 14 years (1987\u20132001), and he did not wear any personal protective equipment during work.
p7617
aVHe denied working for any chemical company other than his present company.
p7618
aVHe occasionally applied pesticides during agricultural work.
p7619
aVAn area sampling program to monitor MBOCA levels in the work environment of this MBOCA manufacturing factory was initiated by the Taiwan Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), Council of Labor Affairs (IOSH 2003a).
p7620
aVThe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) Analytic 0 0 24 was adopted in this study (OSHA 1981).
p7621
aVBriefly, an impinger filled with 0.1N HCl was used for sampling.
p7622
aVThe sampling rate was 1 L/min.
p7623
aVThe sampling time was &gt; 6 hr or &gt; 100 L air.
p7624
aVThe solution was then analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) detector.
p7625
aVThe detection limit was 0.056 \u03bcg/mL.
p7626
aVA quality assurance and quality control program was implemented during the sampling and analysis procedures.
p7627
aVAll quality tests were shown to be adequate (IOSH 2003a).
p7628
aVTwo consecutive days\u2019 air samples were collected in the MBOCA-manufacturing factory, in the areas where the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and cutting/packing processes took place.
p7629
aVThe concentration of MBOCA was highest in the purification area (0.23\u20130.41 mg/m3, n = 2), followed by the washing area (&lt; 0.02\u20130.08 mg/m3, n = 7) and the neutralization area (&lt; 0.05\u20130.06 mg/m3, n = 2) (IOSH 2003a).
p7630
aVThe concentrations of MBOCA were within OSHA permissible exposure level (0.22 mg/m3) except for the purification area, where levels exceeded permissible levels.
p7631
aVIn addition to environmental monitoring, the Taiwan IOSH also collected workers\u2019 urine to monitor MBOCA concentrations.
p7632
aVThe U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analytic method 8302 (NIOSH 1994) and the method used by Robert et al.
p7633
aV(1999) were adopted in this study.
p7634
aVBriefly, sulfamic acid (10 g/L) was used as urine preservative, and urine was neutralized by sodium hydroxide (0.05 g/mL).
p7635
aVAfter cleaning with the Extrelut NT3 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and evaporating with methanol, the concentrated urine was analyzed by HPLC with a 254 nm UV detector.
p7636
aVThe limit of detection was 9.54 \u03bcg/L.
p7637
aVUrine from 10 workers in this MBOCA-manufacturing company was analyzed.
p7638
aVThe total urine MBOCA concentrations ranged from 267.9 to 15701.1 \u03bcg/g creatinine, with a mean of 5,544 \u03bcg/g creatinine (IOSH 2003b).
p7639
aVAll the urine MBOCA concentrations far exceeded the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) reference value of 100 \u03bcg/L (Robert et al.
p7640
aV1999).
p7641
aVAlthough the production of MBOCA in the United States ceased in 1982, MBOCA is still manufactured in other countries.
p7642
aVIt is also widely used, primarily in industries producing castable polyurethane elastomers (ATSDR 1994).
p7643
aVTherefore, the health impact of MBOCA is still of concern in occupational settings in many countries.
p7644
aVIn this article we report the first known case of MBOCA-related occupational bladder cancer in Taiwan, which led to the establishment of recommended exposure levels of MBOCA in the workplace.
p7645
aVThis case report supports the conclusion that MBOCA is a potential human carcinogen.
p7646
aVEnvironmental monitoring of MBOCA levels in ambient air performed in the present study showed that the concentration was high in the purification process area (0.23\u20130.41 mg/m3) and exceeded the OSHA permissible exposure level (0.22 mg/m3) and NIOSH\u2019s recommended exposure level of MBOCA (3 mg/m3 as a 10-hr time-weighted average) (Ward et al.
p7647
aV1990).
p7648
aVThe production quantity of MBOCA at this patient\u2019s plant was about 1,500 tons/year, which was much higher than the 184\u2013580 tons/year reported by Ward et al.
p7649
aV(1990).
p7650
aVThe air levels of MBOCA in this plant were also higher than those in a polyurethane elastomer factory using MBOCA as a curing agent (Clapp et al.
p7651
aV1991).
p7652
aVNo airborne MBOCA was detected in another polyurethane elastomer factory (Clapp et al.
p7653
aV1991).
p7654
aVIn
p7655
aVAND another study, personal sampling of the breathing zone of workers for 6\u20137 hr every other day found levels ranging from 0.002 to 0.0089 mg/m3 (Ichikawa et al.
p7656
aV1990).
p7657
aVIn addition to exposure to high air concentrations of MBOCA, workers in the patient\u2019s plant also showed high levels of MBOCA in urine.
p7658
aVThe urine MBOCA concentrations ranged from 267.9 to 15701.1 \u03bcg/g creatinine with a mean of 5,544 \u03bcg/g creatinine.
p7659
aVThe urine MBOCA concentrations of all 10 workers far exceeded the Cal-OSHA reference value of 100 \u03bcg/L (Robert et al.
p7660
aV1999).
p7661
aVUrine samples obtained by Ward et al.
p7662
aV(1990) from plant workers several months after production ceased also showed detectable MBOCA levels that ranged as high as 50,000 \u03bcg/L.
p7663
aVOsorio et al.
p7664
aV(1990) reported a urine MBOCA level of 1,700 \u03bcg/L 4 hr postexposure in a worker who was accidentally sprayed with molten MBOCA, but no acute symptoms or other laboratory abnormalities were observed.
p7665
aVThe urine MBOCA levels in the MBOCA-manufacturing factory workers were much higher than in workers at a polyurethane elastomer factory using MBOCA as a curing agent.
p7666
aVClapp et al.
p7667
aV(1991) reported concentrations for mixers in the polyurethane elastomer factory ranging from 5 \u03bcg/L to &gt; 100 \u03bcg/L urine (average of 61.9 \u03bcg/L), whereas concentrations for molders were considerably lower (nondetectable to 50 \u03bcg/L urine; average of 14.8 \u03bcg/L).
p7668
aVWorkers in a plant that used MBOCA had urine concentrations of MBOCA ranging from 13 to 458 \u03bcg/L (mean 145 \u03bcg/L; Keeslar 1986).
p7669
aVAnother study of 150 workers with industrial exposure to MBOCA in 19 factories showed that, at the end of the work shift, excretion levels of MBOCA ranged from &lt; 0.5 \u03bcg/L to 1,600 \u03bcg/L, with the highest average urine concentrations (600 \u03bcg/L) in workers directly involved in MBOCA manufacture or use (Ducos et al.
p7670
aV1985).
p7671
aVIn a NIOSH study of urine samples from mixers and molders in a polyurethane elastomer factory (NIOSH 1986), the average urine MBOCA level during the week was approximately 30 \u03bcg/L for a mixer over a 5-day work week; the level dropped to 8.9 \u03bcg/L over the weekend.
p7672
aVHowever, in Australia, monitoring of workers at seven facilities that used MBOCA in the manufacture of polyurethane polymers showed that the average MBOCA levels in the urine of the workers dropped from 29,600 to 10,400 \u03bcg/L within 8\u20139 months after the implementation of an exposure prevention program (Wan et al.
p7673
aV1989).
p7674
aVThe bladder cancer patient reported here worked in the purification process with high exposure to MBOCA for 14 years.
p7675
aVHe did not wear any personal protective equipment during work.
p7676
aVWorkers may inhale small particles of MBOCA in the air or absorb the agent through the skin if they come into contact with MBOCA dust or vapor (Chin et al.
p7677
aV1983; Cocker et al.
p7678
aV1988, 1990; Ichikawa et al.
p7679
aV1990; NIOSH 1986).
p7680
aVAccording to the environmental monitoring data for the patient\u2019s factory, he may have been exposed to high concentrations of MBOCA through inhalation or dermal absorption.
p7681
aVLimited epidemiologic studies have examined the incidence of cancer in workers exposed to MBOCA, and three cases of bladder cancer have been reported to be associated with MBOCA exposure.
p7682
aVWard et al.
p7683
aV(1990) screened 385 MBOCA-exposed workers and revealed a papillary tumor in one worker after cystoscopy; two low-grade papillary transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder were diagnosed in two of the remaining 200 workers examined by cystoscopy.
p7684
aVTwo of the men with bladder cancer in Ward et al.\u2019s study (Ward et al.
p7685
aV1988) were younger than 30 years of age.
p7686
aVThe interval between the time of first exposure and the initiation in that study averaged 11.5 years.
p7687
aVThe latency period in our case was 14 years, which was compatible with that reported by Ward et al.
p7688
aV(1988).
p7689
aVThe present study adds evidence to the potential carcinogenicity of MBOCA.
p7690
aVHuman epidemiologic findings are supported by results obtained in dogs (Stula et al.
p7691
aV1978).
p7692
aVResults in other animal species also support the conclusion that MBOCA is a potential carcinogen (ATSDR 1994).
p7693
aVIn addition to the bladder, other target organs include the lung, liver, breast, and Zymbal\u2019s gland in rats (Kommineni et al.
p7694
aV1979; Russfield et al.
p7695
aV1975; Stula et al.
p7696
aV1975) and the lung, liver, and vascular system in mice (Russfield et al.
p7697
aV1975).
p7698
aVNo adequate epidemiologic studies of MBOCA had been conducted.
p7699
aVThe present case supports the conclusions from other studies that MBOCA is potentially carcinogenic to humans as well as animals, but it does not substitute for the gap between epidemiologic evidence and animal studies.
p7700
aVThis patient was a nonsmoker.
p7701
aVBecause no other potential risk factors of bladder cancer could be found, occupation-related cancer was strongly suspected.
p7702
aVThis case finding supports the conclusion that MBOCA is a potential human carcinogen.
p7703
aVIn most cases, dermal absorption is the most important occupational exposure pathway.
p7704
aVWorkplace monitoring by air sampling has been reported to be useless because contamination may occur in the absence of observable air levels (Clapp et al.
p7705
aV1991).
p7706
aVBiological monitoring of urine MBOCA concentration is a useful method to assess percutaneous MBOCA absorption.
p7707
aVBecause MBOCA is a potential human carcinogen, it is important to reduce exposure primarily through engineering ventilation controls.
p7708
aVHowever, safe use of skin protective equipment and respirators is required to prevent MBOCA exposure.
p7709
aVIn addition, appropriate clearance of spills, work training, air monitoring, and periodic health examinations are recommended (ATSDR 1994; Clapp et al.
p7710
aV1991).
p7711
aVOrganochlorine compounds have been linked to increased risk of several cancers.
p7712
aVDespite reductions in their use and fugitive release, they remain one of the most important groups of persistent pollutants to which humans are exposed, primarily through dietary intake.
p7713
aVWe designed a case-control study to assess the risk of colorectal cancer with exposure to these chemicals, and their potential interactions with genetic alterations in the tumors.
p7714
aVA subsample of cases (n = 132) and hospital controls (n = 76) was selected from a larger case-control study in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
p7715
aVWe measured concentrations in serum of several organochlorines by gas chromatography.
p7716
aVWe assessed point mutations in K-ras and p53 genes in tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism and assessed expression of p53 protein by immunohistochemical methods.
p7717
aVAn elevated risk of colorectal cancer was associated with higher serum concentrations of mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners 28 and 118.
p7718
aVThe odds ratio for these mono-ortho PCBs for middle and higher tertile were, respectively, 1.82 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-3.70] and 2.94 (95% CI, 1.39-6.20).
p7719
aV\u0251-Hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorobenzene, and p,p´-DDE (4,4´-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethene) showed nonsignificant increases in risk.
p7720
aVRisk associated with mono-ortho PCBs was slightly higher for tumors with mutations in the p53 gene but was not modified by mutations in K-ras.
p7721
aVMono-ortho PCBs were further associated with transversion-type mutations in both genes.
p7722
aVThese results generate the hypothesis that exposure to mono-ortho PCBs contributes to human colorectal cancer development.
p7723
aVThe trend and magnitude of the association, as well as the observation of a molecular fingerprint in tumors, raise the possibility that this finding may be causal.
p7724
aVColorectal cancer is the third most common human cancer and the second most important cause of cancer-related death in Western countries, affecting men and women about equally.
p7725
aVThe etiology of sporadic colorectal cancer is relatively poorly understood, although diet is thought to play an important role in modifying risk.
p7726
aVVegetables, fruit, and dietary fiber are protective, whereas red and processed meats, fat, total energy intake, and obesity all increase risk (Potter 1996).
p7727
aVDiet is also an important source of exposure to many synthetic organic chemicals used in industry, agriculture, or accidentally released to the environment.
p7728
aVAmong them, the industrial organochlorine compounds (OCs) hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the pesticides DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and lindane [ \u0263-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), including \u0251-HCH and ß-HCH isomers] have been classified as "probably" or "possibly" carcinogenic to humans [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 1987, 1991].
p7729
aVMost of the data for these classifications come from animal studies, although evidence for carcinogenic effects in humans is accumulating from occupational and nonoccupational exposure studies [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 2000, 2002].
p7730
aVDespite reductions in their use and fugitive release, OCs remain one of the most important groups of persistent pollutants to which humans are exposed, primarily via dietary intake.
p7731
aVMore lipophilic OCs, and those that are not easily metabolized, accumulate in adipose tissue, and the half-lives of these compounds in the body can be on the order of years or decades, whereas those compounds that are more water soluble or more easily metabolized have half-lives on the order of hours or days.
p7732
aVEventually, OCs recirculate in blood and are excreted in feces (Moser and McLachlan 2001).
p7733
aVSerum concentrations are strongly correlated with fecal concentrations, particularly for the more lipophilic compounds that accumulate in adipose tissue and are generally more chlorinated (Juan et al.
p7734
aV2002; Moser and McLachlan 2001).
p7735
aVExposure of tissue in the gastrointestinal tract to OCs is the result, therefore, not only of uptake from food but also of depuration from the tissue to the lumen.
p7736
aVThe long residence time (1-2 days) of feces in the colon offers potentially greater opportunity for exchange of OCs between the lumen and the epithelium than elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.
p7737
aVHowever, the physicochemical characteristics of the compound (specifically, its solubility in water) will be more important in determining the relative importance of these exchange processes in the colon than in the small intestine, given the predominantly aqueous nature of the colonic milieu (Moser and McLachlan 2001; Schlummer et al.
p7738
aV1998).
p7739
aVTherefore, colon epithelium is likely to be a major target for putative carcinogenic effects of OCs via luminal and blood-borne exposure.
p7740
aVOCs have been shown to mimic hormones, and this has been postulated as a mechanism for carcinogenesis in hormone-dependent cancers (Davis et al.
p7741
aV1993).
p7742
aVAlthough colorectal cancer cannot be considered a hormone-dependent cancer, there is evidence that hormones play a role, at least in women: hormone replacement therapy and, possibly, high parity and oral contraceptive use are all protective factors (Potter 1999).
p7743
aVStudies of cancers of the pancreas and breast have shown that OCs may interact with genetic alterations in tumors such as K-ras mutations or p53 overexpression (Hoyer et al.
p7744
aV2002; Porta et al.
p7745
aV1999; Slebos et al.
p7746
aV2000).
p7747
aVResearch on these interactions is relevant because they are frequent in colorectal cancer, and one potential mechanism of OC toxicity may be the induction of mutations in these genes.
p7748
aVDespite this, few studies of OC exposure and colorectal cancer risk have been published.
p7749
aVSome studies in occupationally exposed cohorts have shown mixed results (Acquavella et al.
p7750
aV1996; Bertazzi et al.
p7751
aV1987; Brown 1987; Cantor and Silberman 1999; Leet et al.
p7752
aV1996; Wilkinson et al.
p7753
aV1997), whereas studies with data on individual plasma levels are rare.
p7754
aVOne study of colorectal cancer in children from rural areas exposed to pesticides showed no differences in serum OC levels compared with controls (Caldwell et al.
p7755
aV1981).
p7756
aVHigher (nonsignificant) serum concentrations of DDT and ß-HCH in cases than in controls were reported in a small study of farmers in Egypt (Soliman et al.
p7757
aV1997).
p7758
aVTo test the hypothesis that exposure to OCs plays an etiologic role in colorectal cancer, we determined serum concentrations in a subset of samples from a hospital-based case-control study.
p7759
aVIn addition, we investigated the relationship between OC concentrations and mutations of the K-ras and p53 genes.
p7760
aVStudy population.
p7761
aVWe conducted a hospital-based case-control study to assess gene-environment interactions in relation to colorectal cancer risk.
p7762
aVA detailed description of the population and study methods has already been published (Landi et al.

aVCases were patients with a new diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma attending a university hospital in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, between January 1996 and December 1998.

aVControls were selected from admissions to the same hospital during this period using age and sex as frequency-matching criteria.
p7766
aVTo avoid selection bias of controls, the reason for admission had to be a disease not previously diagnosed for that patient.
p7767
aVThis criterion was used to avoid inclusion of patients with chronic diseases who might be repeatedly admitted to hospital and modify their habits because of their disease.
p7768
aVThis procedure paralleled the criterion for cases, who were also newly diagnosed incident cases.
p7769
aVMain diagnosis groups of controls were acute digestive surgery (19%), urology (17%), gastroenterology (16%), and orthopedic surgery (15%).
p7770
aVThe study protocol was cleared by the ethics committee of the hospital, and all individuals gave written, informed consent to participate and for genetic analysis of their samples to be performed.
p7771
aVOf 523 identified cases, there were 13 (2%) refusals and 74 (14%) exclusions, with reasons including mental or other impairment and death or discharge before recruitment.
p7772
aVWe identified a total of 488 controls, with 36 (7%) refusals and 22 (5%) exclusions (reasons as described above).
p7773
aVFrom these 436 cases and 430 controls, we selected a random sample of 140 cases and 80 controls for OC analyses for budgetary reasons.
p7774
aVThe sample size and imbalance in number between cases and controls was chosen to retain statistical power for our study of K-ras and p53 mutations among cases [80% power to detect odds ratios (ORs) of 2.25 for the exposures of interest].
p7775
aVControls for this study were selected using strata based on age, sex, and energy intake, the latter being used as a frequency-matching criterion because diet is a main source of exposure to OCs.
p7776
aVTwelve samples were lost or excluded because of bad quality during laboratory analyses, and statistical tests were conducted on 132 cases and 76 controls.
p7777
aVInterviews.
p7778
aVCases and controls were interviewed by trained personnel using a structured questionnaire.
p7779
aVA dietary history questionnaire, previously developed and validated in the framework of the EPIC study [European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Group of Spain 1997], focused on average food consumption 1 year before diagnosis.
p7780
aVFood groups based on bromatologic properties were calculated from reports of items consumed.
p7781
aVOther risk factors measured were body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis and 10 years before, parity in women, and life-long history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tobacco, and alcohol use.
p7782
aVOrganochlorine analysis.
p7783
aVSelection of OCs for analysis was based on a literature search of commonly studied contaminants and included representatives of industrial and agrochemical compounds.
p7784
aVAmong the large family of PCB congeners, those often referred to as the ICES 7 (from International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), were selected: mono-ortho PCB congeners 28 and 118 and di-ortho PCBs 52, 101, 138, 153, 180.
p7785
aVThese PCB congeners are frequently found at high concentrations in humans and wildlife.
p7786
aVNonfasting blood samples were obtained at diagnosis, and serum was isolated and analyzed "blind" for OCs.
p7787
aVWe calculated lipid-corrected concentrations of OCs by dividing serum OC concentrations by total plasma lipid concentrations estimated using the formula of Phillips et al.
p7788
aV(1989), and data are expressed in nanograms of OC per gram of lipid.
p7789
aVOCs were analyzed by gas chromatography after serum samples were subjected to liquid-liquid extraction and cleanup using concentrated sulfuric acid and hexane (Porta et al.
p7790
aV1999).
p7791
aVA mass spectrometer in negative chemical ionization mode was used to quantify \u0251-, ß-, \u0263-, and \u018d-HCH isomers; pentachlorobenzene (Pe-CB), HCB, PCB congeners, p,p´-DDT, and p,p´-DDE (4,4´-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethene) were quantified on a gas chromatograph with electron capture detection.
p7792
aVOn both instruments, quantification was performed by external standards using PCB-142 as an injection standard to correct for volume.
p7793
aVThis method performed satisfactorily in an international intercalibration exercise within the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP 2004).
p7794
aVPoint mutations in K-ras and p53 genes, and expression of p53 protein.
p7795
aVFresh tumor tissue and normal mucosa samples were obtained from surgically extracted specimens of cases.
p7796
aVK-ras gene mutations in codons 12 and 13 were detected and characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (Tortola et al.
p7797
aV1999).
p7798
aVAspartic acid mutations at codons 12 and 13 were confirmed by means of artificially introduced restriction fragment length polymorphism.
p7799
aVSimilarly, p53 exons 4-9 were analyzed by PCR and SSCP followed by direct sequencing whenever necessary.
p7800
aVExpression of the p53 protein was determined by immunohistochemistry, using commercially available antibodies (ab-6 Pantropic; Oncogene Research Products, VWR International GmBH, Darmstadt, Germany).
p7801
aVWe studied microsatellite instability by analyzing five microsatellite sequences (Gonzalez-Garcia et al.
p7802
aV2000).
p7803
aVStatistical analysis.
p7804
aVOC concentrations were categorized using tertiles based on all subjects.
p7805
aVSome compounds were not detected in a high proportion of individuals.
p7806
aVFor these, the reference category consisted of values below the detection limit (LOD).
p7807
aVWhen the proportion of individuals with detectable values was &gt; 50%, the values were further divided into two groups using the median value of those with values &gt; LOD.
p7808
aVLogistic regression was used to test the association between OCs and colorectal cancer.
p7809
aVWhen cases were subdivided into groups according to genetic alterations, we used polytomous logistic regression, comparing each group of cases with the whole set of controls.
p7810
aVAll analyses were adjusted for age, sex, total energy intake, and BMI at diagnosis because these had been used as frequency-matching criteria or, in case of BMI, because of concerns about potential confounding of OC exposure by BMI, given that cases showing lower BMI might have undergone lipid-stored OC mobilization.
p7811
aVThe impact of these adjustments on risk estimates was minimal, however.
p7812
aVWe also excluded an association between OCs and tumor stage that would be indicative of bias, because more advanced tumors are associated with greater weight loss.
p7813
aVPotential confounding by other variables associated with disease (alcohol, NSAIDs, and food groups) was explored and rejected.
p7814
aVThese were not included in the models to avoid losing efficiency in the estimates owing to excessive stratification.
p7815
aVORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each group compared with the reference category.
p7816
aVWe tested for linear trend using the categorized variable as quantitative after assigning codes 1 to 3 to each category defined by tertiles.
p7817
aVInteractions between exposures and genetic alterations in tumors were tested with logistic regression models comparing cases with the alteration to cases without it.
p7818
aVAll p-values calculated were two sided.
p7819
aVCharacteristics of cases and controls are shown in Table 1.
p7820
aVSex, age, and energy intake were used as frequency-matching criteria.
p7821
aVBMI estimated 10 years before diagnosis was not related to disease.
p7822
aVIn contrast, BMI at diagnosis was inversely related to disease, probably due to cancer-related weight loss, although no association was found between plasma lipids and disease, or between plasma lipids and OC concentrations.
p7823
aVIn this population, alcohol intake, but not smoking, was a strong risk factor for colorectal cancer, both in duration and in average daily consumption.
p7824
aVNSAIDs other than aspirin were protective but not significantly so.
p7825
aVOC levels.
p7826
aVLipid-corrected concentrations of OCs are shown in Table 2.
p7827
aVThe most abundant compound was p,p´-DDE, followed by HCB and ß-HCH.
p7828
aVSummed PCB concentrations were similar to those of ß-HCH.
p7829
aVThe proportions of samples with values lower than LODs are also shown in Table 2.
p7830
aVPCB-28 and PCB-52 were detected in only a small proportion of cases, although the LOD was very low.
p7831
aVThese compounds are more easily metabolized than are other PCBs because of the arrangement of their chlorine atoms and their lower degree of chlorination (Borlakoglu and Walker 1989).
p7832
aV\u018d-HCH was not detected in any individual, and although Pe-CB and PCB-101 were detected in a few samples, their LODs were higher than other OCs; these three compounds were therefore excluded from statistical analyses.
p7833
aVCompounds were divided into two groups according to water solubility, and cases had slightly higher levels than did controls of both groups (data not shown).
p7834
aVPCBs were grouped according to their structure, which is related to toxicity (ATSDR 2000; Safe 1990).
p7835
aVMono-ortho PCBs 28 and 118 have a relatively "planar" configuration compared with the remaining, di-ortho PCBs measured here.
p7836
aVExposure to mono-ortho PCBs 28 and 118 was almost double in cases compared with controls, whereas exposure to di-ortho PCBs was only slightly higher for cases than for controls.
p7837
aVOC levels and colorectal cancer risk.
p7838
aVTable 3 shows median lipid-corrected concentrations and 5th and 95th percentiles for each compound, separated for cases and controls.
p7839
aVORs for the association of OCs with colorectal cancer, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and energy intake, are shown in Table 4.
p7840
aVThose significantly associated with an increased risk were mono-ortho PCBs 28 and 118, each with individual ORs &gt; 2 for the more exposed category.
p7841
aVThe OR for serum concentrations of the mono-ortho PCB group that combines PCB-28 and PCB-118 was 1.82 (95% CI, 0.90-3.70) in the middle tertile (LOD, 147 ng/g lipid) and 2.94 (95% CI, 1.39-6.20; p-value for trend = 0.004) for the highest tertile.
p7842
aVConcentrations of di-ortho PCBs were not related to disease, nor was the classification of OCs according to their lipophilicity.
p7843
aVHigh levels of \u0251-HCH, HCB, and p,p´-DDE showed a nonsignificant increase in risk.
p7844
aVLevels of p,p´-DDT were lower in cases than in controls in this population.
p7845
aVOC levels and interaction with other variables.
p7846
aVDietary variables, which are both sources of exposure and risk factors for colorectal cancer, were explored as potential confounders.
p7847
aVSpecific food groups explored were vegetables, fruit, legumes, potatoes, meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, added fats, and pastries.
p7848
aVSpearman's correlation coefficients between food groups and serum levels of specific OCs were in general low and nonsignificant (maximum r = 0.19).
p7849
aVExceptions worth mentioning were dairy products, which correlated with p,p´-DDT and PCB-101; fresh meats, which correlated with PCB-101, PCB-153, and PCB-180; and fish, which correlated with PCB-153 and PCB-180.
p7850
aVThe significance of these correlations was poor, and in addition to those correlations mentioned, we observed several negative correlations.
p7851
aVWe also used a multivariate logistic regression model with all food groups to generate a "dietary propensity factor," which could be interpreted as a score integrating the risk of colorectal cancer associated with diet.
p7852
aVAdjusting OCs for this dietary propensity factor did not modify the risk estimates, showing again that diet was not a confounding factor.
p7853
aVHence, after careful consideration, adjustment of the analyses for food groups was found to be unnecessary because foods were not clearly related to serum OC levels and, more important, did not modify the risk estimates.
p7854
aVAn exploratory analysis of interactions between mono-ortho PCBs and several variables was carried out.
p7855
aVThe magnitude of the risk of colorectal cancer observed for these OCs was not modified by sex, age, BMI, smoking, NSAIDs use, or parity in women.
p7856
aVAnalysis of interactions with other hormonal variables in women could not be performed because only six women were exposed to oral contraceptives and only two to postmenopausal hormone replacement treatments.
p7857
aVBecause alcohol was an important risk factor in this study and alcohol intake produces metabolic induction similar to that produced by some OCs (Mochizuki and Yoshida 1989), interactions between OCs and alcohol were explored in detail, but none was significant.
p7858
aVOC levels and mutations at the K-ras and p53 genes.
p7859
aVK-ras was mutated in 50 (38%) cases.
p7860
aVMost frequent mutations were GAT (n = 16) and GTT (n = 15) in codon 12.
p7861
aVIn 6 cases, codon 13 was mutated to GAC.
p7862
aVOther, less frequent mutations in codon 12 were TGT (n = 5), AGT (n = 4), GCT (n = 3), and CGT (n = 1).
p7863
aVTwenty-six mutations were transitions (G:C \u2192 A:T), and 24 were transversions (G: C \u2192 T:A).
p7864
aVTumor suppressor gene p53 was mutated in 59 (60%) of the tumors analyzed (data not available for 34 cases).
p7865
aVTwenty-four mutations were located in hotspots: codon 175 (n = 4), codon 245 (n = 3), codon 248 (n = 3), codon 273 (n = 6), and codon 282 (n = 8).
p7866
aVFour cases harbored mutations at codon 158, the remaining being detected at 24 different codons with frequencies \u2264 2.
p7867
aVForty mutations were transitions, and 15 were transversions; in the remaining four cases, deletions were detected.
p7868
aVThe most frequent base changes were C\u2192T and G\u2192A, each in 17 cases, mainly at hotspot sites.
p7869
aVG\u2192T changes were observed in eight cases and distributed with a nonclustered profile.
p7870
aVThe immunohistochemical analyses showed that 76% of the cases overexpressed the p53 protein.
p7871
aVTable 5 shows the analysis of selected OCs where the cases have been stratified by mutations in K-ras and p53.
p7872
aVThis analysis is based on polytomous logistic regression, and each group of cases is compared with controls in a unified model.
p7873
aVExposure to mono-ortho PCBs 28 and 118 increased risk in similar magnitude for both mutated and wild-type K-ras.
p7874
aVPCB-118, but not PCB-28, showed higher risk for p53-mutated tumors, although the interaction was not significant.
p7875
aVThis stratification of cases by genetic alterations also showed some significant interactions with other OCs.
p7876
aVHigh levels of p,p´-DDE were associated with increased risk of cancer with wild-type K-ras.
p7877
aVAlso, p,p´-DDE and \u0251-HCH had significant effects on p53-mutated tumors.
p7878
aVA similar pattern was evident when tumors were stratified according to p53 overexpression: p,p´-DDE and PCB-118 increased the risk only for tumors overexpressing p53 protein.
p7879
aVTumors with microsatellite instability were rare (n = 11, 8%), and these patients had similar OC levels to other cases.
p7880
aVOverall, 81% of the tumors harbored K-ras and/or p53 gene mutations, and a combined analysis was performed.
p7881
aVExposure to high levels of the mono-ortho PCB-118 was associated with more mutations (OR = 2.89; 95% CI, 0.66-12.7), with transversions three × more likely than transitions (Table 6).
p7882
aVOther OCs analyzed in this way were not related to the type of mutation.
p7883
aVOCs have previously been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancers in studies of occupationally exposed individuals (Acquavella et al.
p7884
aV1996; Soliman et al.
p7885
aV1997; Wilkinson et al.
p7886
aV1997).
p7887
aVOther studies have failed to show this association (Hardell 1981; Hoar et al.
p7888
aV1985; Settimi et al.
p7889
aV2001) or even have shown inverse associations with colon cancer (Cantor and Silberman 1999; Wang et al.
p7890
aV2002).
p7891
aVThese mixed results are not surprising because most occupational studies lack individual exposure indicators and are prone to confounding.
p7892
aVTo overcome these limitations, we studied a population not occupationally exposed using serum OC levels as exposure markers.
p7893
aVWe found an elevated risk of colorectal cancer associated with high levels of mono-ortho PCBs 28 and 118.
p7894
aVOther abundant OCs such as p,p´-DDE and \u0251-HCH also showed an increased risk of relevant magnitude; although the associations for these OCs were not significant for the entire population of cases, they were significant for the subset of tumors harboring mutations of the p53 gene.
p7895
aVWe have taken serum concentrations of OCs as indicative of the body burden.
p7896
aVSerum concentrations are strongly correlated with those in adipose tissue and feces and reflect the historical legacy of uptake and depuration, and as such, they may be taken as markers for long-term, low-level exposure (Alcock et al.
p7897
aV2000; Juan et al.
p7898
aV2002; Moser and McLachlan 2001).
p7899
aVMany studies that also used plasma OC concentrations as exposure markers have reported mixed results for breast cancer (Calle et al.
p7900
aV2002) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Cantor et al.
p7901
aV2003; De Roos et al.
p7902
aV2003; Rothman et al.
p7903
aV1997) but increased risk of pancreatic cancer (Hoppin et al.
p7904
aV2000; Porta et al.
p7905
aV1999; Slebos et al.
p7906
aV2000).
p7907
aVAltogether, these results suggest that a role for OCs in the etiology of several tumors is likely.
p7908
aVNevertheless, the mechanisms underlying carcinogenicity will differ among both OCs and target organs because chemical properties and toxicity mechanisms of these compounds are diverse.
p7909
aVIn addition, target organs differing in lipid content might determine distinct degree of local exposure.
p7910
aVIn our population, high body burdens of mono-ortho PCBs 28 and 118 were associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer.
p7911
aVThese OCs are among the most toxic of the PCBs, together with non-ortho PCBs.
p7912
aVThe relatively flat (or "planar") orientation of their biphenyl rings allows them to bind to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor in a similar way to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans and may be responsible for our finding (Safe 1990).
p7913
aVThis binding induces phase I and phase II metabolic enzymes; mono-ortho PCBs may therefore induce CYP1A and CYP2B enzymes that, in the absence of substrate, can produce reactive oxygen species.
p7914
aVAlthough PCB-118 has a toxic equivalency factor (TEF) of 0.0001, based on its toxicity relative to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (Van den Berg et al.
p7915
aV1998), PCB-28 has not been assigned a TEF under this scheme and may not, therefore, bind strongly to the Ah receptor and/or significantly induce CYP enzymes.
p7916
aVNevertheless, higher serum levels of PCB-28 were associated with increased risk of colon cancer in this study.
p7917
aVSome studies on breast cancer have also reported increased risk being limited to mono-ortho PCBs (Aronson et al.
p7918
aV2000; Demers et al.
p7919
aV2002; Lucena et al.
p7920
aV2001).
p7921
aVPCBs themselves are hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, and their metabolites have been shown to induce DNA adducts invitro (McLean et al.
p7922
aV1996).
p7923
aVWe have not observed a clear differential risk for PCB-28 or PCB-118 in relation to K ras or p53 mutations.
p7924
aVHowever, when mutations in both genes were classified according to their molecular nature, an association between transversions (less likely to occur spontaneously) and exposure to mono-ortho PCBs was observed.
p7925
aVThis could be interpreted as indirect evidence for a molecular fingerprint associated with exposure to these pollutants.
p7926
aVThe role of other OCs in colorectal cancer risk may be more complex.
p7927
aVCompounds such as p,p´-DDE and \u0251-HCH that had an overall moderate association with colorectal cancer showed a significant increase in risk for tumors with mutation of the p53 gene.
p7928
aVA similar result was reported in a Danish study, where higher risk of breast cancer with mutated p53 was observed among women exposed to high levels of dieldrin and PCBs (Hoyer et al.
p7929
aV2002).
p7930
aVIn our population, p,p´-DDE also increased risk for tumors with wild-type K-ras but not when this oncogene was mutated.
p7931
aVPrevious studies in pancreatic cancer have provided mixed results regarding OC exposure and K-ras mutation status associated with DDE levels (Porta et al.
p7932
aV1999; Slebos et al.
p7933
aV2000).
p7934
aVSeveral factors suggest that these findings may be causal: the strength and trend of the associations observed; the restriction of the findings to mono-ortho PCBs that have a relatively planar, dioxin-like structure; the existence of similar findings in tumors from other organs; the plausibility of carcinogenic mechanisms; and the association with specific mutation types.
p7935
aVWe are aware, however, that this study also has several limitations.
p7936
aVOwing to the limitations of our analytical method, we did not study non-ortho PCBs that have a greater affinity for the Ah receptor than do mono-ortho PCBs as a result of their "coplanar" molecular structure, which may have strengthened our hypothesis.
p7937
aVThe retrospective assessment of exposure in the case-control design is not ideal, and the use of hospital controls may introduce information and selection bias.
p7938
aVWe minimized these biases by careful design, the use of validated questionnaires administered by trained interviewers, and robust analytical methods.
p7939
aVHowever, potential sources of nondifferential bias would tend to decrease the magnitude of any positive relationship; in particular, if OC exposure increased the risk of hospital admission, this would bias the associations toward the null hypothesis.
p7940
aVFurthermore, potential confounding factors were explored in detail and rejected.
p7941
aVSpecial effort was devoted to explore whether the weight loss observed among cases could explain the results, because OCs accumulate in lipids, and changes in BMI due to metabolism of adipose tissue in cancer patients could result in higher serum levels of OCs.
p7942
aVHowever, three observations combine to negate this possibility: a) adjusting for BMI had only a minor effect on risk estimates; b) although more advanced cases exhibited severe weight loss, there was no association between OC levels and tumor stage; and c) if lipid mobilization was the reason for observing higher OC levels among cases, this would be true for all OCs but especially the more lipophilic compounds, whereas we observed increased risk only for selected OCs, and these were less lipophilic than p,p´-DDT and PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-180, for which no increased risk was observed.
p7943
aVNevertheless, we cannot exclude chance as an explanation of some of the results because this study was conceived as exploratory or hypothesis generating and we performed many statistical comparisons.
p7944
aVIn conclusion, these results suggest that exposure to mono-ortho PCBs is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
p7945
aVThe trend and magnitude of the association and the specific toxic action of these PCBs, linked with transversion-type mutations, suggest that this finding may be causal.
p7946
aVThis hypothesis merits confirmation in other studies that would benefit from including other mono-ortho PCBs, as well as non-ortho PCBs and perhaps dioxins/furans.
p7947
aVDespite the endocrine system activity exhibited by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), recent studies have shown little association between PCB exposure and breast cancer mortality.
p7948
aVTo further evaluate the relation between PCB exposure and breast cancer risk, we studied incidence, a more sensitive end point than mortality, in an occupational cohort.
p7949
aVWe followed 5,752 women employed for at least 1 year in one of three capacitor manufacturing facilities, identifying cases from questionnaires, cancer registries, and death certificates through 1998.
p7950
aVWe collected lifestyle and reproductive information via questionnaire from participants or next of kin and used semiquantitative job-exposure matrices for inhalation and dermal exposures combined.
p7951
aVWe generated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized rate ratios and used Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate potential confounders and effect modifiers.
p7952
aVOverall, the breast cancer SIR was 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.72\u20130.92; n = 257), and regression modeling showed little effect of employment duration or cumulative exposure.
p7953
aVHowever, for the 362 women of questionnaire-identified races other than white, we observed positive, statistically significant associations with employment duration and cumulative exposure; only smoking, birth cohort, and self- or proxy questionnaire completion had statistically significant explanatory power when added to models with exposure metrics.
p7954
aVWe found no overall elevation in breast cancer risk after occupational exposure to PCBs.
p7955
aVHowever, the exposure-related risk elevations seen among nonwhite workers, although of limited interpretability given the small number of cases, warrant further investigation, because the usual reproductive risk factors accounted for little of the increased risk.
p7956
aVThe increase in breast cancer rates in recent decades has prompted researchers to explore the role of environmental factors in breast cancer etiology.
p7957
aVOne such factor is exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were manufactured in the United States for a variety of commercial uses from the 1930s until the late 1970s, when they were banned.
p7958
aVThese environmentally persistent compounds have exhibited endocrine system activity in the laboratory (Bonefeld-Jorgensen et al.
p7959
aV2001; Letcher et al.
p7960
aV2002; Oenga et al.
p7961
aV2004) and thus are of concern with respect to reproductive system effects, including breast cancer.
p7962
aVA systematic review found that total PCB exposure is not an important predictor for breast cancer in the general population (Negri et al.
p7963
aV2003).
p7964
aVSome recent studies raise the possibility of differential genetic susceptibility, specifically with respect to CYP1A1 polymorphisms (Li et al.
p7965
aV2004, 2005).
p7966
aVIf adverse human health effects from exposure to PCBs exist, they would most readily be identified in groups with the greatest exposures, such as worker populations.
p7967
aVElectrical capacitor production workers have been followed in several studies.
p7968
aVHighly exposed workers (~ 2,500 individuals, including 1,318 females) in two plants that produced electrical capacitors in New York State and Massachusetts were studied by Brown and Jones (1981); the cohort was later updated by Brown (1987).
p7969
aVThe New York facility was included in mortality studies by Kimbrough et al.
p7970
aV(1999, 2003).
p7971
aVMore recently, Prince et al.
p7972
aV(2006b) expanded the cohort to include all workers at both facilities, regardless of exposure potential, in an update that employed a newly developed job-exposure matrix (JEM).
p7973
aVWorkers from a capacitor manufacturing plant located in Indiana were assessed in another retrospective cohort study (Sinks et al.
p7974
aV1992).
p7975
aVAn update of this study (Ruder et al.
p7976
aV2006) used a new JEM to estimate exposures.

aVPCBs were used in capacitor production starting in 1939 at the Massachusetts plant, 1946 at the New York plant, and 1957 at the Indiana plant.
p7978
aVThe United States banned production of PCBs in 1977 (Smith and Brown 1987).
p7979
aVNo previous study of these capacitor worker cohorts found large or significant elevations for female breast cancer mortality, and studies that examined exposure\u2013response trends by duration (Prince et al.
p7980
aV2006a) or exposure level (Prince et al.
p7981
aV2006b) found no significant results.
p7982
aVHowever, mortality is not a sensitive end point for outcomes with a high survival rate, such as breast cancer.
p7983
aVTherefore, we decided to assess the relation between PCB exposure and female breast cancer incidence in a combined study of these three capacitor worker cohorts.
p7984
aVThe study population consisted of women included in prior retrospective cohort mortality studies of workers at three capacitor manufacturing plants in the United States.
p7985
aVPlants 1 and 2, located in New York State and Massachusetts, respectively, employed a total of 13,321 women.
p7986
aVPlant 3, located in Indiana, had 857 female employees.
p7987
aVFrom the combined base cohort of 14,178 potentially PCB-exposed women, we restricted the present study to the 5,752 women who worked for at least 1 year at any of the three capacitor plants (41% of the total).
p7988
aVThe minimum employment restriction was motivated by the difficulty in locating women with short-term employment for questionnaire follow-up.
p7989
aVFollow-up for breast cancer incidence began after 1 year of employment.
p7990
aVThis project received approval from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Human Subjects Review Board (HSRB).
p7991
aVPer the HSRB-approved protocol, a returned questionnaire was considered implied informed consent.
p7992
aVFor study participants interviewed by telephone, we obtained oral informed consent before the interview.
p7993
aVWe mailed a self-administered questionnaire to all women or their next of kin for whom we could determine valid addresses.
p7994
aVAfter two mailings and a reminder postcard, we telephoned nonrespondents to obtain the information.
p7995
aVWe identified addresses and telephone numbers using sources such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S.
p7996
aVPostal Service, motor vehicle registration records, credit bureaus, and telephone number lookup services.
p7997
aVThe questionnaire collected information on a) incident breast and other cancer diagnoses and details necessary to confirm diagnoses via medical records; b) relevant nonoccupational risk factors for breast cancer, such as family history and reproductive history; and c) demographic and lifestyle information such as ethnicity, education, height, weight, and smoking history.
p7998
aVBecause we knew that plant 2 included a number of workers of Cape Verdean origin, we offered Spanish- and Portuguese-language translations of the questionnaire to non-English-speaking respondents upon request.
p7999
aVQuestionnaires were collected from 1998 through 2000.
p8000
aVWomen reporting breast cancer diagnoses after 1998 were not considered cases.
p8001
aVReliable information on race was generally not available from plant records.
p8002
aVFor many deceased workers, we obtained race information from death certificates and other vital status sources.
p8003
aVThe questionnaire actively sought race information, asking women to select from the following categories: white, black, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and other.
p8004
aVRespondents selecting \u201cother\u201d for race were prompted to further specify their race.
p8005
aVThe questionnaire asked separately whether the worker was of Hispanic origin.
p8006
aVFor the present study, we used race data from the plants and from death certificates only for calculating preliminary standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized rate ratios (SRRs).
p8007
aVIn these analyses, we assumed workers of unknown race to be white.
p8008
aVWe limited further analyses evaluating the effects of race to the subcohort with questionnaire data and used only the self- or proxy-reported data to classify workers by race.
p8009
aVThis approach differs from that used in previous studies of these cohorts (Prince et al.
p8010
aV2006a, 2006b; Ruder et al.
p8011
aV2006; Steenland et al.
p8012
aV2006), which used all data sources but prioritized questionnaire data.
p8013
aVWe opted to use only questionnaire-reported race for consistency and because of the potential for greater specificity.
p8014
aVVital status follow-up began in 1940 for the New York and Massachusetts facilities, and in 1957 for the Indiana plant, which opened in that year.
p8015
aVPrevious mortality studies of the cohorts (Brown and Jones 1981; Brown 1987; Prince et al.
p8016
aV2006a, 2006b; Ruder et al.
p8017
aV2006) used Social Security Administration (SSA), state motor vehicle registration, and state vital statistics offices to ascertain vital status in workers who died before 1979, and SSA, IRS, and National Death Index data for follow-up after this date.
p8018
aVFor all time periods, we used follow-back services such as the U.S.
p8019
aVPostal Service and credit bureaus to complete ascertainment.
p8020
aVWe sought death certificates from state vital statistics offices and had underlying cause of death coded by trained nosologists according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) revision in effect at time of death (e.g., World Health Organization 1977).
p8021
aVFor the present study, the end date for breast cancer incidence and mortality ascertainment was 31 December 1998.
p8022
aVWe identified additional breast cancer cases using questionnaires and cancer registries.
p8023
aVCancer registries were available in all three of the states in which the plants were located, but for varying periods of time (Massachusetts, 1982\u20131998; New York, 1976\u20131998; Indiana, 1987\u20131998).
p8024
aVAfter we obtained the most current addresses, we evaluated the distribution by state of address and decided to also match our file against the Florida registry (covering 1981\u20131998) and the California registry (covering 1988\u20131998).
p8025
aVMatching is done by staff at the registries, and data are not available to the public.
p8026
aVQuestionnaire data were available for 201 of the 281 identified breast cancer cases (72%).
p8027
aVIf the report of breast cancer by a woman (or her next of kin) was specifically contradicted by another source of information (e.g., the medical record), we did not include the report as a case (n = 10).
p8028
aVHowever, we included breast cancer cases reported in medical or cancer registry records (even if unreported by a woman or her next of kin) in the analysis (n = 82).
p8029
aVWe also included breast cancer cases for which we obtained no medical record.
p8030
aVMedical record or cancer registry confirmation of the diagnosis was available for 43% and 55% of cases, respectively.
p8031
aVWe obtained dates of breast cancer diagnosis from self-report, proxy report, the medical record, cancer registry record, or the death certificate.
p8032
aVWhen diagnosis dates from multiple sources conflicted, we used the earliest date considered most valid (e.g., we considered medical record and cancer registry dates more valid than self-reported dates).
p8033
aVFor breast cancer decedents with only death certificate information (n = 10), we used the date of death as the date of diagnosis unless timing of diagnosis was otherwise noted on the death certificate, in which case we adjusted the date accordingly.
p8034
aVWork history data from the three plants were collected by NIOSH in the mid-1970s.
p8035
aVThe plants began using PCBs at different times, but the overall exposure period for the cohort ranged from 1939 until 1977.
p8036
aVWe used plant-specific semiquantitative JEMs to allow ranking of exposure intensity for all workers across all three plants and across time.
p8037
aVSources used to develop the JEMs included work history records, a small number of air samples from the mid-1970s, information about historical process changes, job descriptions, and plant layouts.
p8038
aVSeparate JEMs for inhalation and dermal exposures in each plant used the same scale for exposure scores across plants and routes of exposure.
p8039
aVWe used an average of inhalation and dermal exposure scores to create the final plant-specific JEMs.
p8040
aVThese scores are unitless, because the dermal component could not be quantified; in the analysis, cumulative exposures are summed 1,000 unit-years.
p8041
aVThe exposure assessment process has been described in detail (Nilsen et al.
p8042
aV2004a, 2004b, 2005).
p8043
aVWe compared serum PCB levels from a sample of workers at two of the three plants with cumulative exposure scores calculated via the JEMs for the respective plants.
p8044
aVCumulative exposures estimated via the JEM correlated reasonably well with serum PCB levels (Steenland et al.
p8045
aV2006), with a higher correlation than that between duration of exposure and serum PCB level (Nilsen NB, Waters MA, Hein MJ, Ruder AM, unpublished data).
p8046
aVEach plant had one department for which the exposure level could not be estimated but we believed to be low; for these departments, we used the lowest assigned estimate for the pertinent time period at that facility.
p8047
aVWe used the NIOSH Personal Computer Life Table Analysis System (PC-LTAS) to determine whether the incidence of breast cancer in the study cohort was higher than that expected from general population rates (Steenland et al.
p8048
aV1998).
p8049
aVWe constructed a referent rate file using data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) population for the period 1970\u20131999 (Ries et al.
p8050
aV2002), for invasive female breast cancer (ICD-9 code 174) and in situ breast cancer (ICD- 9 code 233.0).
p8051
aVAnalyses using SEER referent rates produced SIRs and SRRs by categories of cumulative exposure and exposure duration, stratified by age (in 5-year categories), calendar time (in 5-year categories), and, for some analyses, race (white and nonwhite).
p8052
aVFollow-up time began in 1970 when the SEER rates became available, or 1 year after employment, whichever was later.
p8053
aVBeginning follow-up in 1970 eliminated 24 (8.5%) of the 281 breast cancer cases and 34.3% of the person-time from LTAS analyses only.
p8054
aVFollow-up continued until the date of diagnosis, date of death, study end date (31 December 1998), or last known date before loss to follow-up, whichever was earliest.
p8055
aVWe also conducted lagged analyses to allow for the necessary latency period for solid tumors, with 0-, 10-, and 15-year lags examined.
p8056
aVThis lag discounts all exposure in the last years before the cutoff date, and sometimes results in a worker having no exposure or being \u201clagged out.\u201d For exposure\u2013response analyses, LTAS calculated a linear trend in a person-year\u2013weighted regression of directly standardized rates, with statistical significance of each trend determined using a two-tailed Z-test with an \u03b1 of 0.05.
p8057
aVWe conducted internal exposure\u2013response analyses using Cox regression.
p8058
aVWe used the SAS PHREG procedure (SAS Institute Inc. 2006), with age as the time variable (effectively matching on age).
p8059
aVRisk sets for each case included all those who started working at a younger age than the index case\u2019s age at diagnosis and who survived without breast cancer to at least that age.
p8060
aVWe truncated exposure at the age of the index case at diagnosis.
p8061
aVIn contrast with the SIR/SRR analyses, we retained lagged out workers in the regression analyses, with a zero dose assigned for the lagged out period.
p8062
aVWe limited regression analyses for the full cohort (5,752 workers) to exploring exposure metrics and birth cohort effects.
p8063
aVWe considered several exposure metrics: cumulative exposure (log-transformed and untransformed), duration of exposure (log-transformed and untransformed), peak exposure, and average exposure (cumulative exposure divided by duration of exposure).
p8064
aVWe analyzed all metrics as continuous and categorical, with lags of 0, 10, and 15 years evaluated.
p8065
aVWe performed similar analyses for the subset of workers with some questionnaire data (the \u201cquestionnaire subcohort\u201d) to see whether risks were similar in the two groups.
p8066
aVBecause of the importance of certain covariates in assessing the relations between PCB exposure and breast cancer risk, we restricted further analyses to workers with complete questionnaire data on covariates of a priori interest (the \u201crestricted subcohort\u201d).
p8067
aVWe required members of the restricted subcohort (n = 3,141) to have data on parity, age at first live birth, replacement hormone use (ever and age at first use), whether a first-degree female relative had had breast cancer, and ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes.
p8068
aVWe assessed menopausal status but did not include it as a restricting factor; instead, we imputed the age of 52 for women for whom menopausal status or age at menopause was missing (n = 249).
p8069
aVWe knew from prior studies (Brown 1987; Brown and Jones 1981; Prince et al.
p8070
aV2006a, 2006b; Ruder et al.
p8071
aV2006; Sinks et al.
p8072
aV1992) that the individual plants differed in exposure distribution, race, and percent hourly versus salaried, factors that could potentially affect breast cancer risk.
p8073
aVTherefore, we evaluated the role of facility to determine whether further analyses should be restricted to individual facilities.
p8074
aVIn addition, because researchers have reported differences by ethnic background in PCB body burden in the vicinity of one of the plants (Choi et al.
p8075
aV2006),
p8076
aVwe evaluated race as a potential confounder warranting separate analyses.
p8077
aVWe also wanted to consider race in evaluating between facility differences, but only one facility (plant 2) had more than a single case among nonwhite workers.
p8078
aVWe also assessed the role of self- versus proxy-reported data.
p8079
aVWe performed covariate analyses on the restricted cohort, using backward elimination to rule out the least influential of the potential confounders.
p8080
aVWe also examined key interaction terms, evaluating statistical significance with the chi-square likelihood ratio test.
p8081
aVAmong the full cohort of 5,752 women, the mean ± SD duration of employment was 7.7 ± 4.5 years.
p8082
aVA total of 1,413 (25%) had died by the study end date.
p8083
aVWe obtained completed questionnaires for 3,952 (69%) of the cohort, 80% from living respondents and 20% from next of kin of deceased cohort members.
p8084
aVThe primary reason for nonresponse was our inability to determine a correct address (21%).
p8085
aVA total of 500 former workers and proxy respondents (8.7%) refused to complete the questionnaire, and 112 (2%) failed to respond after repeated attempts.
p8086
aVWe found 281 incident breast cancer cases in the full cohort.
p8087
aVAlthough mortality follow-up of the cohort was exhaustive, nonfatal incident cases occurring before initiation of the cancer registries or occurring in states other than Massachusetts, New York, Indiana, Florida, and California could be ascertained only via questionnaire.
p8088
aVApproximately 20% of the cohort did not return a questionnaire and were not known to be deceased at end of follow-up; incident cases occurring outside the registry search may have been missed in this group, particularly in the early years of follow-up.
p8089
aVOf the full cohort, we identified 147 women by plant records and death certificates as being of races other than white.
p8090
aVWhen we used the questionnaire responses instead, the number of workers (both cases and noncases) identified as being of races other than white rose to 282.
p8091
aVThis group includes workers identifying as members of specific races other than white (black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, or Pacific Islander), women who identified only as \u201cother,\u201d and women identifying as multiracial.
p8092
aVBecause the number of workers identifying as other than white was small, we kept this group together for all further analyses and refer to it herein as \u201cnonwhite,\u201d although some women in fact selected a multiracial identity where one of the races was white.
p8093
aVOf the 281 cases in the full cohort, we identified only eight as nonwhite from plant or death certificate data.
p8094
aVHowever, among workers with complete questionnaire data on the covariates of a priori interest (restricted cohort), we identified 14 of the 145 cases as nonwhite.
p8095
aVTwelve of these were from plant 2.
p8096
aVOf the 268 noncase workers identified as nonwhite on the questionnaire, 67 identified as African American, and 201 identified as \u201cother.\u201d Most workers (n = 150) in the last group did not further specify their race/ethnicity; of those who did, 90% (n = 55) identified themselves solely as Cape Verdean or as Cape Verdean and some other ethnicity.
p8097
aVTable 1 provides selected demographic and exposure characteristics of the breast cancer cases and noncases in the entire cohort (n = 5,752) and the questionnaire subcohort (n = 3,952).
p8098
aVIn the entire cohort, on average, cases (n = 281) were born earlier than noncases and were exposed longer; these differences were highly statistically significant.
p8099
aVCases also had higher cumulative exposures.
p8100
aVBreast cancer in situ was reported for 8 of the 281 cases (2.8%).
p8101
aVMore data were available for the questionnaire subcohort, including demographic and lifestyle characteristics.
p8102
aVAgain, cases (n = 201) were born significantly earlier than noncases and were exposed longer.
p8103
aVCases had higher mean cumulative exposure than did noncases, but the difference was not statistically significant.
p8104
aVCases were significantly more likely to have a first-degree relative with breast cancer than were noncases.
p8105
aVAverage age at first live birth showed a slight but statistically significant difference.
p8106
aVThere were no statistically significant differences between case and noncases in the average age at menarche, body mass index (BMI), parity, number of children, use of hormone replacement therapy, age at first use of hormone therapy, or in the proportion of nonwhites or ever-smokers.
p8107
aVThe plants differed in a number of ways.
p8108
aVMost striking were the contrasts in exposure distributions.
p8109
aVMean ± SD estimated exposure for the workforce of plant 2 (0.80 ± 1.06, 1,000 unit-years) was more than twice that in plant 1 (0.34 ± 0.71) and was an order of magnitude greater than that in plant 3 (0.078 ± 0.10).
p8110
aVThe medians reflected a similar pattern (plant 2 = 0.39, plant 1 = 0.11, and plant 3 = 0.04).
p8111
aVAlthough all three facilities had nonwhite populations &lt; 4% according to records-based data, we classified &gt; 15% of workers at plant 2 as nonwhite using questionnaire data.
p8112
aVThe percentages of nonwhite workers for plants 1 and 3 increased only slightly when we used questionnaire data.
p8113
aVIn the aggregate, white and nonwhite workers in the restricted subcohort differed on a number of demographic and lifestyle factors (Table 2).
p8114
aVStatistically significant differences included higher mean and median cumulative exposures, fewer pack-years of smoking, greater number of live births, and a greater percentage with a first-degree female relative with breast cancer among nonwhite workers.
p8115
aVMean exposure durations for the two groups were similar.
p8116
aVWe saw more striking differences among cases: The median exposure for nonwhite cases was nearly double the 75th percentile of exposure for white cases; in contrast, for noncases, the mean was only slightly higher in nonwhites and the median was actually slightly higher in whites.
p8117
aVSIR and SRR results reflect follow-up time and cases occurring in 1970 or later, because of availability of SEER comparison data.
p8118
aVFor the full cohort, the unlagged SIR was 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72\u20130.92; n = 257] and using a 10-year lag was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71\u20130.92; n = 251 cases).
p8119
aVSRRs by exposure level showed no trend using lagged or unlagged data.
p8120
aVHowever, the SIRs and SRRs differed somewhat by race.
p8121
aVFor women identified as white by plant records or death certificates, the SIRs were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70\u20130.90; n = 250) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70\u20130.90; n = 244) with 0- and 10-year lags, respectively.
p8122
aVFor women identified as nonwhite by records (all facilities), the SIRs had nonsignificant elevations of 1.87 (95% CI, 0.75\u20133.84; n = 7) and 1.94 (95% CI, 0.77\u20133.99; n = 7) for 0- and 10-year lags respectively.
p8123
aVSIRs for women with questionnaire data were similar to those for the full cohort in white women (unlagged SIR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72\u20130.97; n = 176; 10-year lag SIR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72\u20130.97; n = 172) but showed a more modest elevation in nonwhite women (unlagged SIR = 1.14; 95% CI, 0.59\u20131.99; n = 12; 10-year lag SIR = 1.17; 95% CI, 0.06\u20132.03; n = 12) than that seen in the full cohort.
p8124
aVSRR results differed depending on dose cut points and lag (data not shown), particularly for white women, with no consistent patterns observed.
p8125
aVIn nonwhite women, trends were always positive and sometimes statistically significant, depending on cut points and lag.
p8126
aVHowever, elevations were limited to the highest dose categories, with deficits observed in some intermediate categories.
p8127
aVTable 3 shows results of main effects exposure\u2013response analyses via Cox regression using the full, questionnaire, and restricted cohorts.
p8128
aVTo account for secular trends in breast cancer incidence, all models included variables for birth cohort (before 1920 as a referent, 1920\u20131934, and \u2265 1935).
p8129
aVAlthough the exposure metrics were right skewed, the untransformed metrics fit the data best.
p8130
aVFor the full cohort, neither of the exposure metrics achieved statistical significance.
p8131
aVCumulative exposure was not associated with elevations in breast cancer incidence for the full cohort, the questionnaire subcohort, or the restricted subcohort; exposure duration showed a statistically significant association with risk only in the restricted cohort.
p8132
aVResults for external and internal analyses did not differ greatly with the inclusion or exclusion of in situ cases.
p8133
aVBecause the SRR results suggested a difference in risk by race,
p8134
aVAND we evaluated the effects of race in the regression analyses and then conducted further evaluations of potential confounders and effect modifiers in the restricted cohort separately for nonwhite and white women.
p8135
aVTable 4 provides the results of these analyses.
p8136
aVAlthough the unlagged model fit best for most exposure metrics (cumulative, duration) in white women, a 10-year lag fit better in nonwhite women.
p8137
aVWe had doubts about the biologic plausibility of a zero lag and chose the 10-year lag for further modeling.
p8138
aVAmong white women, cumulative exposure and duration of exposure had little effect on breast cancer risk.
p8139
aVBirth cohort was significant, with an increased risk for the group born during the period 1920\u20131934 and a larger increase compared with baseline for those born after 1934.
p8140
aVBeyond birth cohort, the covariates retained in the model were parity, family history of breast cancer, and self- versus proxy questionnaire completion.
p8141
aVPlant did not strongly affect the relation between the exposure metrics and breast cancer risk, and we eliminated this variable from the model.
p8142
aVUse of hormone replacement therapy, although technically a confounder, had a lesser effect on risk, and we also eliminated this variable from the final model in the interest of parsimony.
p8143
aVMenopausal status was not a confounder in this group.
p8144
aVIn contrast, among nonwhite women, the effects of increasing exposure were positive and statistically significant.
p8145
aVBoth cumulative exposure (continuous) and duration of exposure were highly associated with breast cancer risk.
p8146
aVCategorical exposure was associated with elevated risk at the two highest levels, but not in the intermediate category.
p8147
aVThe variables usually considered breast cancer risk factors (family history, parity, use of hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status) had little effect on risk in this group (data not shown).
p8148
aVThe most important covariates for this cohort were ever-smoking, source of questionnaire data, and birth cohort (limited to those women born after 1934).
p8149
aVIn univariate analyses, nonwhite cases smoked more than noncases (46 vs. 29 pack-years), in part because they smoked for more years (42.6 vs. 32.9).
p8150
aVWe did not observe these patterns among white workers.
p8151
aVTo assess whether smoking might be a proxy for alcohol use, we examined models with smoking but not alcohol, with alcohol but not smoking, and with both alcohol and smoking and found that only smoking had significant explanatory value.
p8152
aVTo further explore the effects of smoking in nonwhite workers, we considered current smoking status (at time of death for deceased workers or time of questionnaire completion for living workers) and pack-years.
p8153
aVAdding pack-years or current smoking status to a model that included ever smoking had little effect.
p8154
aVThe interaction between current smoking status and cumulative exposure nearly attained statistical significance (p = 0.06).
p8155
aVBecause the mean and median PCB exposure estimates were significantly higher among nonwhite workers,
p8156
aVwe considered the possibility that the greater risk observed in nonwhite women was attributable to a high-exposure effect.
p8157
aVWe reevaluated the exposure risk in white women using the same cut points employed for nonwhite women and found the same lack of trend we observed with the original quartile-based cut points.
p8158
aVThe lack of exposure\u2013response in white women does not appear to be related to the lower exposure levels in this group.
p8159
aVIn this study of breast cancer incidence among female workers employed in capacitor production facilities, differences in risk by race, although subject to a number of caveats, were evident.
p8160
aVIn white women, the SIR was below expectation, and in the modeling analyses, the very small positive exposure response observed was largely explained by the well-known risk factors parity, age at first live birth, and family history of breast cancer.
p8161
aVDifferences between the SIR and exposure\u2013response results likely resulted from differences in covariate control, in addition to differences between the subcohorts used in the SIR and regression analyses; despite these differences, we observed no statistically significant elevation of risk in any subcohort of white women.
p8162
aVThese results suggest that among white women, if there is a relation of PCB exposure with breast cancer risk, it is likely quite modest, even at the relatively high levels characteristic of occupationally exposed populations.
p8163
aVIn contrast, among nonwhite women, whereas the SIR was close to expectation, the strong, positive exposure response seen in regression analyses was only modestly attenuated by smoking, birth cohort, and source of questionnaire data (self or proxy), the only covariates with significant explanatory power.
p8164
aVRace was not a variable of strong a priori interest, and these findings may be the result of chance or uncontrolled confounding.
p8165
aVThe small number of nonwhite cases further limits interpretation of the findings in this group.
p8166
aVIn both white and nonwhite women, risk of breast cancer after PCB exposure was lower for women born before 1920 than for those born after 1934.
p8167
aVThe pattern of increasing breast cancer incidence risk for later birth cohorts is generally consistent with results reported from the SEER registry (Holford et al.
p8168
aV2006) and the Connecticut Cancer Registry (Holford et al.
p8169
aV1991).
p8170
aVThe study has several potential limitations.
p8171
aVResponse bias is a possibility when questionnaires are used.
p8172
aVIf nonrespondents had lower breast cancer rates than respondents, an artificial excess of breast cancer would be observed in the exposed population versus the nonexposed referent population.
p8173
aVTo minimize the likelihood of such bias, the study materials referred not to breast cancer but to \u201chealth effects.\u201d
p8174
aVOf greater concern is that ascertainment of incident breast cancer cases was likely better for the later years of the study, when cancer registry data were available to supplement death records and questionnaire data.
p8175
aVAlthough we identified only 10 breast cancer deaths using death certificates alone, it is likely that nonfatal incident cases were missed in the early years.
p8176
aVThis would lead to underestimates of the SIR and could affect exposure\u2013response analyses, because early exposures were substantially higher than those in later years.
p8177
aVIn addition, this could affect observed secular trends.
p8178
aVOn the other hand, we could not verify some of the cases identified via questionnaire either by medical records or by a cancer registry, so we cannot rule out limited overascertainment.
p8179
aVCompletion of questionnaires by proxy respondents likely introduced misclassification on some covariates.
p8180
aVProxy respondents often left blanks in response to some questions, so the restricted cohort underrepresents deceased workers.
p8181
aVIn addition, proxy respondents may also have been less accurate in responses to questions they did answer.
p8182
aVWhen we performed a sensitivity analysis evaluating proxy and self-respondents in the restricted cohort separately, we found that results for each group were quite similar to those for all respondents combined, although risk estimates were slightly higher among self-respondents.
p8183
aVErrors in reporting of smoking are potentially problematic, given the results in nonwhite women.
p8184
aVStudies have shown that smoking status is reported more accurately by proxies than was number of cigarettes smoked (Lerchen and Samet 1986; Steenland and Schnorr 1988).
p8185
aVWe used ever/never in the final model to minimize reporting bias and to avoid further restricting the cohort.
p8186
aVThe positive exposure response persisted whether we included or excluded smoking covariates.
p8187
aVMisclassification of PCB exposure is another potential limitation.
p8188
aVWe assessed exposure levels by job title, department, and work process, with limited air sampling data available from the 1970s only.
p8189
aVThe combination of dermal and inhalation exposures into a single semiquantitative estimate does not account for differences in doses by route of exposure.
p8190
aVIn addition, the use of total PCBs as the exposure metric may obscure the effects of individual congeners or subgroups.
p8191
aVRace, although an important predictor for breast cancer risk after PCB exposure in this study, is not well defined for this cohort.
p8192
aVIn addition to general concerns about using race in place of more specific information about genetics to explain disease risk (Harty et al.
p8193
aV2006; Kolonel et al.
p8194
aV2004), this study is hampered by marked discrepancies between race identified from records-based sources and race identified via questionnaire.
p8195
aVIn addition, whereas most nonwhite workers who more fully specified their race via questionnaire identified as either African American or Cape Verdean, more than half of the non-white workers self-identified as \u201cother\u201d and failed to further define their race.
p8196
aVThe potential for marked heterogeneity among those identifying as \u201cother,\u201d as well as the small number of nonwhite cases, cautions against overinterpretation.
p8197
aVFurther specification of ethnic origins of all members of the cohort would be of interest because other studies raise the possibility that differences in nonoccupational exposure levels and/or genetic susceptibility could contribute to observed differences in risk by race.
p8198
aVA study of women residing near a PCB-contaminated harbor in New Bedford, Massachusetts, close to where plant 2 is located, found higher PCB levels in infants of women from Portugal, the Azores, and Cape Verde compared with those born in the United States, Canada, or other countries (Choi et al.
p8199
aV2006).
p8200
aVThe authors considered the contributions of diet (i.e., fish consumption) but not occupational exposures.
p8201
aVIn addition, studies have found race-related differences in genetic polymorphisms that may affect PCB metabolism (Li et al.
p8202
aV2005), and slight elevations in breast cancer risk after PCB exposure in postmenopausal African-American women with CYP1A1 M3 genotypes who smoked &gt; 20 years (Li et al.
p8203
aV2004),
p8204
aVsuggesting the possibility of complex interactions between genes, lifestyle factors, and PCB-related breast cancer risk in a population subset.
p8205
aVSmoking is not generally considered a risk factor for breast cancer.
p8206
aVThe smoking results in the present study may represent a chance finding, or smoking may be a proxy for some other risk factor (although we ruled out alcohol, one obvious possibility) or a vehicle for greater but unmeasured PCB exposure through hand-to-mouth ingestion.
p8207
aVThe lack of any significant overall increase in risk of breast cancer after PCB exposure in this occupational cohort is reassuring and consistent with the results of previous studies of the contributing cohorts (Prince et al.
p8208
aV2006a, 2006b; Ruder et al.
p8209
aV2006).
p8210
aVChance and residual confounding cannot be ruled out as explanations for the positive relation between PCB exposure and breast cancer risk among nonwhite women; however, this finding, which was not attenuated by reproductive factors, warrants further exploration.
p8211
aVThe effect of occupational exposure to styrene on frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and binucleated cells with micronuclei and on single-strand break levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied in 86 reinforced plastic workers and 42 control individuals (including 16 maintenance workers with intermittent, low-dose exposure).
p8212
aVIn these individuals, the irradiation-specific DNA repair rates and the repair rates of 8-oxoguanines were investigated.
p8213
aVWe assessed the exposure by measuring the concentrations of styrene in air and in blood and of mandelic acid, phenylglyoxylic acid, 4-vinyl phenol conjugates and regioisomeric phenyl hydroxyethyl mercapturic acids in urine.
p8214
aVAll these parameters correlated with one another.
p8215
aVNo clear relationship was found between the styrene exposure and the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations.
p8216
aVBinucleated cells with micronuclei were moderately related to the parameters of styrene exposure.
p8217
aVWe found a negative correlation between all exposure parameters and single-strand breaks.
p8218
aVThe positive correlation between exposure parameters and DNA repair rates suggests that particular DNA repair pathways may be induced by styrene exposure.
p8219
aVStyrene is used widely in the production of plastics, synthetic rubber, and polyester resins and occurs as an environmental contaminant, present in small amounts in food items, tobacco smoke, and engine exhausts.
p8220
aVOccupational exposure in hand lamination work in the reinforced plastic industry may entail a daily intake of gram quantities of styrene via inhalation [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2002].
p8221
aVMany genetic toxicology assays are positive for styrene [reviewed by World Health Organization (WHO) 2001].
p8222
aVIARC has classified styrene as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B), with limited evidence for carcinogenicity in humans and in experimental animals, whereas its main intermediary metabolite, styrene-7,8-oxide (StO), has been classified as a probable human carcinogen (group 2A; IARC 1994, 2002).
p8223
aVStyrene metabolism has recently been reviewed (Vodicka et al.
p8224
aV2002).
p8225
aVStO, formed from styrene by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, is primarily detoxified by microsomal epoxide hydrolase to phenylethylene glycol, which is further metabolized to yield mandelic acid (MA) and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA), the principal urinary metabolites.
p8226
aVTo a minor extent, StO is conjugated with glutathione by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), resulting in subsequent formation of phenyl hydroxyethyl mercapturic acids (PHEMAs), excreted in urine.
p8227
aVAn alternative oxidation on the aromatic ring leads to the formation of 3,4-arene oxide, which may contribute to the styrene genotoxicity (Pfaffli et al.
p8228
aV1981).
p8229
aVThis metabolic pathway can be monitored by measuring urinary 4-vinyl phenol conjugates (4-VPT; Manini et al.
p8230
aV2003).
p8231
aVStyrene is known to induce DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) in human white blood cells (Vodicka et al.
p8232
aV1999) as well as cytogenetic damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of styrene-exposed workers (Artuso et al.
p8233
aV1995; Somorovska et al.
p8234
aV1999; Tates et al.
p8235
aV1994).
p8236
aVA recent hypothesis has postulated that oxidative stress may arise as a result of imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants and contributes to the genotoxic effects of styrene exposure (Marczynski et al.
p8237
aV2000).
p8238
aVThe discrepancies between an excessive, long-lasting occupational exposure to styrene and relatively low levels of measured biomarkers (Koskinen et al.
p8239
aV2001; Vodicka et al.
p8240
aV2003) and inconclusive outcomes from cancer epidemiology studies (Kogevinas et al.
p8241
aV1993) indicate that various mechanisms connected with styrene biotransformation and DNA repair may be of importance.
p8242
aVRecent studies have reported that GSTM1 genotype along with GSTT1 genotype may affect the genotoxicity of styrene in human lymphocytes in vitro (Bernardini et al.
p8243
aV2002) and urinary excretion of PHEMAs in styrene-exposed workers (Haufroid et al.
p8244
aV2002).
p8245
aVIn addition, genetic polymorphisms of biotransformation enzymes have been suggested to modulate the genotoxicity in styrene-exposed workers (Vodicka et al.
p8246
aV2001), although no strict conclusions can yet be drawn.
p8247
aVThus far, little information is available on the possible effect of styrene exposure on DNA repair rates.
p8248
aVAn early study indicated that styrene exposure, both in vivo and in vitro, increased unscheduled DNA synthesis induced in human mononuclear leukocytes by N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene but not by ultraviolet radiation (Pero et al.
p8249
aV1982).
p8250
aVThe authors concluded that styrene exposure does not alter the efficiency of DNA repair synthesis but only the susceptibility of DNA toward damages from chemical mutagens that depend on cellular metabolism.
p8251
aVHowever, preliminary studies using the comet assay have suggested that the capacity of lymphocytes to remove both \u0263-ray-induced DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage is increased in styrene-exposed workers (Vodicka et al.
p8252
aV2003).
p8253
aVIn the present study, we examined the effect of occupational exposure to styrene on the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and binucleated cells (BNs) with micronuclei (MN) and on the level of SSBs and SSB endonuclease III (Endo III) sites in peripheral lymphocytes.
p8254
aVAn innovative aspect was an investigation of the irradiation-specific DNA repair rates and the repair rates of 8-oxoguanines.
p8255
aVWhether the level of various biomarkers is modulated by polymorphisms in DNA repair genes as well as by individual DNA repair rates (particularly those related to styrene-induced DNA lesions) in styrene-exposed subjects has to be addressed in the future investigation.
p8256
aVSubjects.
p8257
aVThe styrene-exposed group consisted of 86 workers employed in three plants (designated A, B, and C) located in the same area.
p8258
aVThe control group consisted of 26 employees of the Regional Hygienic Station (external control; EC) and 16 maintenance workers from plant B (plant control; PC).
p8259
aVThe design of the study was approved by the local ethical committee, and all participants provided their informed consent.
p8260
aVThe sampling of biologic material was carried out according to the Declaration in Helsinki (World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 1964).
p8261
aVThe exposed and control workers had similar socioeconomic background; the exposed subjects were, in comparison with the controls, on average 8.7 years younger, included more men (71 vs. 52%) and smokers (51 vs. 19%), and had smoked about twice as many cigarettes during their lifetime (Table 1).
p8262
aVThese differences were taken into account in the statistical analyses.
p8263
aVStyrene exposure in workplace air and in blood.
p8264
aVThe concentration of styrene in the workplace air was determined by personal dosimeters the day of the sampling (Vodicka et al.
p8265
aV1995).
p8266
aVThe determination of styrene concentration in blood has been described previously (Vodicka et al.
p8267
aV1995, 2001).
p8268
aVStyrene-specific urinary metabolites.
p8269
aVAn aliquot of urine was collected at the end of shift concomitantly with other samplings and used for the determination of the styrene-specific urinary metabolites MA, PGA, 4-VPT, and regioisomeric PHEMAs.
p8270
aVThe methodologies have been described previously for MA and PGA (Symanski et al.
p8271
aV2001), for 4-VPT (Manini et al.
p8272
aV2002), and for the PHEMAs diastereomeric N-acetyl-S-(1-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-cysteine (M1RR), (M1RS), and N-acetyl-S-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-cysteine (M2) (Ghittori et al.

p8277
aVSSB Endo III sites, reflecting abasic sites and oxopyrimidines, were evaluated by a modified version of comet assay with Endo III treatment (Collins et al.

aVOne hundred metaphases per sample for CA and 1,000 BNs/sample for MN were scored from coded slides.

aVDNA repair rates.
p8285
aVPeripheral blood lymphocytes isolated using Ficol gradient were used to test individual DNA repair capacity as described previously (Alapetite et al.
p8286
aV1999; Vodicka et al.
p8287
aV2003).
p8288
aVBriefly, cells embedded in agarose on slides were irradiated with 5 gray (Gy) of \u0263-rays (0.42 Gy/min) and either lysed immediately or incubated at 37°C for 40 min before the lysis.
p8289
aVThe DNA breaks induced by \u0263-rays are repaired according to the individual repair capacity, and the results are expressed as amount of repaired SSBs.
p8290
aVSimultaneously with the analysis in human lymphocytes, irradiation-induced SSBs and remaining SSBs in various intervals were assayed for in human fibroblasts.
p8291
aVThis test confirmed that SSB removal is measured and the time interval is appropriate (Figure 1).
p8292
aVIn addition, the individual capacity of peripheral lymphocyte extracts to repair 8-oxoguanine, known to be removed from DNA by a specific glycosylase (oxoguanine glycosylase; OGG1), was determined as previously described (Collins et al.
p8293
aV2001).
p8294
aVBriefly, HeLa cells were pretreated with the photosensitizer Ro 19-8022 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), irradiated with a fluorescent lamp to induce 8-oxoguanine, incubated with cell extracts prepared from lymphocytes of each subject, and analyzed by the comet assay.
p8295
aVThe level of SSBs reflected the removal of 8-oxoguanine from HeLa cell DNA by the lymphocyte extract.
p8296
aVStatistical analyses.
p8297
aVStatistical calculations were performed using Statgraphics, version 7 (Manugistics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA).
p8298
aVThe data were not normally distributed, and nonparametric tests were used: Mann-Whitney U-test for testing significant differences between groups, Spearman correlation analysis for estimation of the correlation between parameters, and the Kruskal-Wallis test for the associations between biomarkers.
p8299
aVAll analyses were performed with coded samples.
p8300
aVStyrene exposure.
p8301
aVThe mean styrene concentration in the workplace air, determined by personal dosimeters in three plants, was 81.3 ± 56.3 mg/m3; the highest mean concentration was in plant A, followed by plant C and plant B (Table 1).
p8302
aVStyrene concentration in blood was, on average, 0.56 ± 0.43 mg/L in the exposed group and 0.07 ± 0.06 mg/L in the controls (Table 1).
p8303
aVIn the control group, styrene concentrations in blood were exclusively recorded among the plant controls, suggesting that low-level, intermittent exposure to styrene might occur among the maintenance workers.
p8304
aVAlthough these workers were not directly involved in the styrene processing (as declared also in questionnaires), the low-level styrene exposure was further supported by the levels of urinary metabolites.
p8305
aVIn exposed workers, the concentrations of styrene in the air were correlated with those in blood (R = 0.817, p &lt; 0.001).
p8306
aVStyrene-specific urinary metabolites.
p8307
aVThe styrene metabolites determined in the urine of laminators followed the levels shown by external exposure parameters (Table 1).
p8308
aVThe mean levels of MA, PGA, and 4-VPT in the laminators were more than 10 times higher than those of the plant controls.
p8309
aVIn the exposed workers, urinary concentrations of various PHEMAs were 1.8 ± 4.1 mg/g creatinine for M1RR and M1RS, and 1.4 ± 3.2 mg/g creatinine for M2.
p8310
aVPHEMAs were not determined in the control groups.
p8311
aVAll urinary metabolites in all exposed individuals and in workers from each particular plant correlated strongly with each other as well as with the concentrations of styrene in the air and in blood (data not shown).
p8312
aVCytogenetic markers.
p8313
aVCA frequencies are presented in Table 2.
p8314
aVThe highest mean CA frequency was in the EC group (3.2 ± 2.0), and the lowest was in the plant controls (1.7 ± 0.9; p = 0.042).
p8315
aVWorkers from plant A, exposed to the highest styrene concentration (mean, 112 mg/m3), exhibited the second highest CA frequency (2.5 ± 1.6) but did not differ significantly from the other groups.
p8316
aVResults on chromatid-type aberrations (with and without gaps) and on chromosome breaks followed the same pattern as the frequency of total aberrant cells (Table 2) and did not correlate with any marker of styrene exposure.
p8317
aVCA frequencies correlated positively with age (R = 0.223, p = 0.014); this correlation was more pronounced for chromosome-type CA (R = 0.228, p = 0.012).
p8318
aVNo influence of other confounders on CA frequencies was recorded.s
p8319
aVThe highest mean BN MN frequency was recorded among the workers from plant A and the ECs, and the lowest was in plant controls (Table 2).
p8320
aVAn association between BN MN frequency and styrene exposure (p = 0.001 for styrene in air and p = 0.001 for styrene in blood) was found.
p8321
aVIn addition, BN MN frequency correlated with MA, PGA, and 4-VPT (data not shown).
p8322
aVSignificantly elevated BN MN frequencies were found in individuals with a higher index for cumulative exposure (styrene concentration in air multiplied by duration of exposure) than in those with a lower index (17.6 ± 7.2 vs. 13.9 ± 6.2, p = 0.017; Figure 2).
p8323
aVBN MN frequencies significantly increased with age (R = 0.231, p = 0.013) and were higher in women than in men (F = 25.7, p &lt; 0.001).
p8324
aVSSBs in DNA and SSB Endo III sites.
p8325
aVThe lower mean level of SSBs was recorded in plant A in comparison with both plant and ECs (Table 2).
p8326
aVIn fact, SSBs negatively correlated with most markers of styrene exposure (R = -0.350, p = 0.007 for styrene in blood; R = -0.402, p = 0.01 for MA; R = -0.403, p = 0.001 for PGA; R = -0.375, p = 0.003 for 4-VPT).
p8327
aVDecrease of SSBs with increasing concentration of styrene in air is illustrated in Figure 3A.
p8328
aVSSB levels were not affected by any confounder recorded.
p8329
aVThe mean level of SSB Endo III sites were not significantly different among different groups of exposed subjects and in comparison with the control individuals (Table 2).
p8330
aVThe levels of SSB Endo III sites did not correlate with any of the exposure markers, including urinary metabolites.
p8331
aVDNA repair rates.
p8332
aVAs shown in Figure 1, most SSBs induced by \u0263-rays are rapidly removed from DNA with an approximate half-life of 15-20 min.
p8333
aVThere is still residual DNA damage, which may be unrepaired double-strand breaks (DSBs).
p8334
aVIndividual capacity to repair SSBs induced by \u0263-rays was significantly lower in the ECs, compared with all exposed groups (p = 0.023 vs. plant A, p = 0.016 vs. plant B, p = 0.001 vs. plant C; Table 2).
p8335
aVIrradiation-specific DNA repair rates were associated with styrene concentration in air (Figure 3B), correlated significantly with styrene in blood (R = 0.308, p = 0.031), and showed a tendency to decrease with increasing age (R = -0.204, p = 0.095).
p8336
aVThe capacity of lymphocytes to incise 8-oxoguanine in the different groups is shown in Table 2.
p8337
aVThe only significant (&gt; 2-fold) increase in the DNA repair was recorded among workers from plant A (p = 0.0006 vs. plant B, p = 0.0007 vs. plant C, p = 0.0003 vs. plant controls, p = 0.015 vs. ECs).
p8338
aVRepair capacity to remove oxidative DNA damage increased with increasing styrene concentration in air (Figure 3C) and correlated significantly with styrene in blood (R = 0.371, p = 0.004) and with urinary metabolites (R = 0.414, p = 0.002 for MA; R = 0.428, p = 0.001 for PGA; R = 0.336, p = 0.010 for 4-VPT).
p8339
aVIn this study, we examined the levels of specific urinary metabolites and chromosome and DNA damage in relation to DNA repair rates in styrene-exposed workers.
p8340
aVExposure assessment.
p8341
aVThe strong correlations observed between measures of external and internal styrene exposure and styrene-specific urinary metabolites have been well documented (Vodicka et al.
p8342
aV1999).
p8343
aVAs an interesting new finding concerning the metabolites, the urinary excretion of both 4-vinyl phenol conjugates 4-vinyl phenol glucuronide and 4-vinyl phenol sulfate was exposure dependent, indicating that 3,4-arene oxidation takes place in styrene metabolism in humans and may contribute to the genotoxic burden.
p8344
aVAlthough this metabolic pathway has been previously postulated (Pfaffli et al.
p8345
aV1981), the biologic relevance of styrene-3,4-oxide, for example, in terms of DNA adduct formation has yet to be investigated.
p8346
aVExposure-dependent excretion of diastereomeric PHEMAs in workers provides only limited information, because conjugation of StO with glutathione represents a minor metabolic pathway (&lt; 1% of the total urinary metabolites), and is highly dependent on GSTM1 polymorphism.
p8347
aVGSTM1-positive individuals have been shown to excrete five to six times more PHEMA than do GSTM1-negative subjects (De Palma et al.
p8348
aV2001).
p8349
aVCytogenetic markers.
p8350
aVIn contrast to previous findings (Artuso et al.
p8351
aV1995; Somorovska et al.
p8352
aV1999), we did not observe any effect of styrene exposure on CA frequencies; nor were chromatid-type aberrations, previously shown to be indicative of styrene treatment (Jantunen et al.
p8353
aV1986), increased in the exposed subjects.
p8354
aVThe BN MN frequencies were associated with the concentrations of styrene in the air and in blood and of urinary metabolites and with cumulative exposure index, suggesting an effect of the occupational exposure on MN formation, after adjustment for known confounders (age and sex).
p8355
aVHowever, the differences in the mean BN MN frequency between the exposed group and ECs were negligible, whereas the plant control group showed the lowest BN MN frequency.
p8356
aVRemarkably, a higher BN MN frequency in the EC group may be due to the known confounders affecting this end point: age and sex (Fenech 1998); indeed, the EC group consisted mainly of women with higher mean age.
p8357
aVSimilar considerations may be plausible for frequencies of CAs.
p8358
aVSSBs and SSB Endo III sites.
p8359
aVSSBs in DNA were significantly lower in exposed workers than in those unexposed and correlated inversely with parameters of internal exposure.
p8360
aVThis is in striking contrast to previous studies (Vodicka et al.
p8361
aV1999), where an exposure-related increase in SSBs was found and SSBs correlated significantly with O6-styrene-guanine DNA adducts (Vodicka et al.
p8362
aV1995) and CA (Somorovska et al.
p8363
aV1999).
p8364
aVThis discrepancy may be caused by differences among the populations examined: The previous consisted of individuals exposed for 14 years on average, whereas workers in the present study were exposed to styrene for less than 4 years.
p8365
aVOn the other hand, in the present study the relatively lower SSB levels in exposed workers were associated with more efficient DNA repair capacities, whereas in previous reports DNA repair rates were not addressed.
p8366
aVSSB Endo III sites, reflecting either abasic sites or oxopyrimidines, were almost identical in both the exposed and control groups, but in contrast to our previous study (Somorovska et al.
p8367
aV1999), we recorded this type of DNA damage at clearly distinguishable levels.
p8368
aVBecause oxidative DNA damage may arise because of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors and SSB Endo III sites represent a nonspecific marker, it is difficult to pinpoint the origin of this DNA damage in the present population.
p8369
aVThe role of oxidative stress related to styrene exposure may be a contributing factor, as indicated by increased levels of 8-hydroxyguanine DNA adducts among workers exposed to styrene (Marczynski et al.
p8370
aV2000).
p8371
aVDNA repair rates.
p8372
aVTo screen individual DNA repair rates, we employed a modified comet assay on irradiated human lymphocytes.
p8373
aVThe comet assay is a useful tool for the DNA damage and repair assessment (Dikomey et al.
p8374
aV2000; Popanda et al.
p8375
aV2003),
p8376
aVbut its version based on alkaline denaturation does not allow discrimination of simultaneously induced SSBs and DSBs.
p8377
aVIrradiation-induced (\u0263-rays) DNA damage consists of mainly SSBs (90%), whereas DSBs account for 10% (Sakai and Okada 1984).
p8378
aVBecause most of the DNA damage induced by irradiation is repaired very quickly, this repair pathway may be attributable to base excision repair.
p8379
aVIn fact, the irradiation-related DSBs are repaired with half-life of more than 2 hr (Dikomey and Franzke 1986) via nonhomologous recombination repair (Natarajan 2002).
p8380
aVWe investigated individual capacities to repair SSBs induced by irradiation.
p8381
aVOn the other hand, SSBs were also analyzed as an indicator of DNA damage without any information on their specificity and origin.
p8382
aVDespite the limitations in specificity, the association between the actual levels of SSBs and the capacities of their repair is important.
p8383
aVCapacity to repair irradiation-specific DNA damage was significantly higher in exposed workers than in unexposed or moderately exposed subjects.
p8384
aVThe apparent increase in DNA repair rates related to styrene exposure may reflect effective activation of the DNA repair machinery.
p8385
aVAn increased capacity of lymphocytes to incise 8-oxoguanine was recorded among highly exposed workers.
p8386
aVSignificant association between both internal and external exposure parameters and repair capacity to remove oxidative DNA damage suggests a possible role of oxidative stress in styrene-related genotoxicity, as previously postulated.
p8387
aVHowever, until we address combinations of various exposure parameters and multiple markers of early effect, interpretations should be cautious, and the complexity of the biologic system has to be considered in order to prevent simple mechanistic extrapolation.
p8388
aVIn styrene-exposed workers, genotoxic effects may depend on the extent of exposure, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility in several biotransformation and DNA repair genes, as well as adaptation processes.
p8389
aVAs suggested by the present pilot study, the role of individual DNA repair rates deserves further investigation.
p8390
aVBisphenol A (BPA) is widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, including infant formula bottles.
p8391
aVBased on the reported endocrine disruptor activity of this polyphenol, we hypothesized that exposure to BPA early in life would elicit developmental changes in the mammary tissue and cause a predisposition for mammary cancer.
p8392
aVWe exposed neonatal/prepubertal rats to BPA via lactation from nursing dams treated orally with 0, 25, and 250 \u03bcg BPA/kg body weight/day.
p8393
aVFor tumorigenesis studies, female offspring were exposed to 30 mg dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/kg body weight at 50 days of age.
p8394
aVThe combination of DMBA treatment with lactational exposure to BPA demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in mammary tumor multiplicity and reduced tumor latency compared with controls.
p8395
aVIn the absence of DMBA treatment, lactational BPA exposure resulted in increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis at 50 but not 21 days postpartum (shortly after last BPA treatment).
p8396
aVUsing Western blot analysis, we determined that steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) 1\u20133, Akt, phosphorylated Akt, progesterone receptor A (PR-A), and erbB3 proteins were significantly up-regulated at 50 days of age.
p8397
aVThe data presented here provide the first evidence that maternal exposure to BPA during lactation increases mammary carcinogenesis in a DMBA-induced model of rodent mammary cancer.
p8398
aVChanges in PR-A, SRC 1\u20133, erbB3, and Akt activity are consistent with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis playing a role in mammary cancer susceptibility.
p8399
aVThese alterations provide an explanation of enhanced mammary carcinogenesis after lactational BPA exposure.
p8400
aVBreast cancer etiology attributed to hereditary causes is low, accounting for an estimated 5\u201315% of all diagnosed cases (Colditz and Frazier 1995).
p8401
aVExtrinsic factors, such as environment and lifestyle, may play substantial roles in the high incidence of breast cancer.
p8402
aVRoutine exposures to certain environmental contaminants, especially those with the ability to alter endocrine signaling, are currently being scrutinized for their potential roles in breast cancer causation.
p8403
aVOne such example can be found in the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES).
p8404
aVWomen were prescribed DES from 1947 until 1971 to prevent miscarriages.
p8405
aVNot only was the drug therapeutically ineffective, but reports have established that women exposed in utero to DES showed an increased incidence of a rare type of vaginal cancer and an increased risk of developing breast cancer (Herbst et al.
p8406
aV1999; Troisi et al.
p8407
aV2007).
p8408
aVThese effects, occurring more than a decade after the original exposure, have caused greater public awareness of the role of early endocrine-disruptor exposure in lifetime breast cancer susceptibility.
p8409
aVLikewise, recent media attention has focused on another common environmental endocrine disruptor, bisphenol A (BPA), as a potentially harmful chemical because of its widespread exposure to humans and reported endocrine-disruptor activity.
p8410
aVBPA is ubiquitous in modern society.
p8411
aVThe main source of BPA stems from its widespread use to manufacture polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins used in beverage and food containers, infant formula bottles, canned food liners, and some dental sealants, among other uses.
p8412
aVHowever, the bonds that connect the BPA monomers are weak and highly subject to degradation even with normal use (Le et al.
p8413
aV2008).
p8414
aVFactors such as time, higher temperatures, and pH extremes accelerate this process (Kang et al.
p8415
aV2003).
p8416
aVCalafat et al.
p8417
aV(2005) found that 95% of adults surveyed (n = 394) had detectable concentrations of total (free plus conjugated) urinary BPA.
p8418
aVIn a pilot study of the concentrations of a panel of environmental chemicals in the urine of young girls, Wolff et al.
p8419
aV(2007) reported similar findings.
p8420
aVThey reported total BPA concentrations ranging from below the limit of detection (0.3 \u03bcg BPA/L) to 54.3 \u03bcg BPA/L, with an average value of 2.0 \u03bcg BPA/L (3.0 \u03bcg BPA/g creatinine).
p8421
aVA large-scale investigation supported these previous studies (Calafat et al.
p8422
aV2008), finding detectable concentrations of total BPA in 93% of &gt; 2,000 participants, averaging 2.6 \u03bcg BPA/L.
p8423
aVFurthermore, concentrations of total BPA increased with decreasing age.
p8424
aVChildren (6\u201311 years of age) had the highest concentrations of total BPA [least square geometric mean (LSGM), 4.5 \u03bcg BPA/L], significantly higher than those of adults (LSGM, 2.5 \u03bcg BPA/L) (Calafat et al.
p8425
aV2008).
p8426
aVBPA has been found to leach from polycarbonate infant formula bottles and as free and conjugated forms in breast milk, suggesting several sources for early BPA exposure and creating the concern that long-lasting adverse health effects may arise as a consequence (Brede et al.
p8427
aV2003; Sun et al.
p8428
aV2004; Ye et al.
p8429
aV2006).
p8430
aVSeveral studies using animal models have linked early exposure to BPA with developmental and reproductive abnormalities in both sexes (Ho et al.
p8431
aV2006; Howdeshell et al.
p8432
aV1999).
p8433
aVPerinatal exposure to BPA at 0.1 or 1.2 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day through drinking water significantly increased body weight, altered estrous cyclicity, and significantly lowered plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (Rubin et al.
p8434
aV2001).
p8435
aVPerinatal exposure to BPA at 250 ng/kg bw/day through an osmotic pump caused significant alterations in the mammary gland, including an increased number of terminal end buds (TEBs), decreased apoptosis in TEBs, an increased percentage of cells expressing the progesterone receptor (PR), and increased lateral branching (Munoz-de-Toro et al.
p8436
aV2005).
p8437
aVWith gestational exposure alone, BPA advanced puberty and increased the number of terminal ducts, TEBs, alveolar buds, and preneoplastic lesions in the mammary gland (Markey et al.
p8438
aV2001; Murray et al.
p8439
aV2007).
p8440
aVThese and other studies provide a substantial amount of evidence to warrant further investigation into the potential deleterious effects caused by early exposure to BPA, especially in terms of mammary carcinogenesis.
p8441
aVWe sought to determine whether early exposure to BPA could accelerate mammary carcinogenesis in a dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) model of rodent mammary cancer.
p8442
aVWe treated lactating dams with low concentrations of BPA: 25 \u03bcg/kg/day, which is one-half of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) daily oral reference dose of 50 \u03bcg/kg/day (BPA 25 group), and 250 \u03bcg/kg/day, which is 200-fold less than the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 50 mg/kg/day (BPA 250 group) (National Toxicology Program 1982).
p8443
aVThus, the present study provides the first evidence that oral administration of low concentrations of BPA to lactating dams can increase mammary cancer susceptibility of the female offspring in a DMBA-induced model.
p8444
aVOur data suggest that the mechanism of action behind this response is mediated through increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis and centers on an up-regulation of steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) proteins, erbB3, and Akt signaling in the mammary gland.
p8445
aVAnimal care and use were conducted according to established guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
p8446
aVAnimals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering.
p8447
aVAll animals were housed in a temperature- controlled facility with a 12 hr light/dark cycle.
p8448
aVFemale Sprague Dawley CD rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC) were bred and observed for the presence of sperm.
p8449
aVSperm-positive females were separated, housed in polypropylene cages with glass water bottles (both polycarbonate/BPA free), and fed phytoestrogen-free AIN-93G pelleted diet (Harlan Teklad Global Diets, Wilmington, DE).
p8450
aVOn day 2 post-partum, all female offspring (5\u20138) and enough males to yield 10 offspring/litter were retained.
p8451
aVBeginning on postpartum day 2 and continuing through postpartum day 20, the lactating dam of each litter was intragastrically gavaged with sesame oil vehicle (SO) or with BPA at 25 \u03bcg/kg/day (BPA 25) or 250 \u03bcg/kg/day (BPA 250) on Monday through Friday only (a total of 15 treatments).
p8452
aVBecause dam treatment for lactational exposure results in a single exposure group per treatment, we used only one offspring from each litter in each experiment.
p8453
aVWe purchased BPA and sesame oil from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).
p8454
aVWe purchased antibodies to erbB2, Bax, phosphorylated Bad, Bcl-2, caspase 2, caspase 3, and cleaved caspase 3 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); antibodies to erbB3, estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1), and PR-A and PR-B from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and antibodies to SRC-1, SRC-2/TIF2, and SRC-3/AIB1 from Becton, Dickenson and Company (Franklin Lakes, NJ).
p8455
aVAt 50 days of age, one female offspring from each litter of each treatment group was given a single gavage of DMBA 30 mg/kg bw.
p8456
aVThis dose results in a low number of mammary tumors and allows chemicals that predispose for mammary cancer to increase the number of mammary adenocarcinomas (Brown et al.
p8457
aV1998).
p8458
aVBecause dam treatment for lactational exposure results in a single exposure group per treatment, we used only one offspring from each litter in each experiment.
p8459
aVThere were 32, 34, and 24 female offspring in the SO, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups, respectively, all derived from individual litters.
p8460
aVWe palpated animals twice weekly to monitor tumor development and recorded data on palpable tumor latency, location, tumor burden, and multiplicity.
p8461
aVAnimals underwent necropsy at 12 months of age or when tumor burden exceeded 10% of body weight.
p8462
aVAll tumors and gross lesions were dissected out, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin, and sections were prepared for pathologic evaluation.
p8463
aVCoded slides were classified as to tumor type, tissue of origin, and degree of invasiveness by a board-certified pathologist (I.E.).
p8464
aVHistopathologic characterization of mammary neoplastic lesions included carcinoma grade, proliferation index, and malignancy evaluations, as described by Meyer et al.
p8465
aV(2005).
p8466
aVWhen animals were 21 and 50 days of age, we processed two sets of identically treated rats using ketamine/xylazine anesthesia for live collection of mammary glands.
p8467
aVThe fourth abdominal mammary glands were collected from each rat; one set of the mammary glands was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunoblotting (n = 8 per treatment group), and the contralateral glands were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin (n = 5 per treatment group).
p8468
aVAt 50 days of age, all females were killed during the estrous phase.
p8469
aVAt 50 days of age, female offspring lactationally exposed via dams treated with BPA 250 or an equal volume of sesame oil were decapitated and trunk blood was collected.
p8470
aVWe measured serum 17\u03b2-estradiol and progesterone concentrations using radioimmunoassays (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX) as described by the manufacturer.
p8471
aVAll samples were run in duplicate, with eight samples per group, by J. Mahan (Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, University of Alabama at Birmingham).
p8472
aVTo determine cell proliferation, tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 \u03bcm and placed on glass slides.
p8473
aVThe slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated through xylene and graded alcohol washes.
p8474
aVSlides were boiled in citrate buffer for 15 min, incubated in hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidases, and blocked using the appropriate serum.
p8475
aVWe incubated the slides in Ki-67 primary antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) overnight in a humidified chamber.
p8476
aVAfter incubating the tissue sections in the appropriate conjugated secondary antibody, we employed the use of the ImmPRESS kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
p8477
aVPositively stained cells were visualized by incubating the tissue sections with 3,3\u2032-diamonobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin.
p8478
aVTissue sections were dehydrated with graded alcohols, cleared with xylene, and mounted with a glass coverslip.
p8479
aVWe used five biologically distinct samples derived from individual litters, and counted a minimum of three TEB structures per slide.
p8480
aVWe assessed cell proliferation by noting intense nuclear staining for Ki-67 protein.
p8481
aVWe determined the rate of apoptosis using the ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon International, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.
p8482
aVThis method detects the apoptotic cells by the indirect TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) method.
p8483
aVCells that stained positively and exhibited morphologic characteristics of apoptosis were counted as positive.
p8484
aVWe used five biologically distinct samples per treatment and counted a minimum of three TEB structures per slide.
p8485
aVWe diced whole mammary glands and homogenized them in RIPA lysis buffer (Pierce Biotechnolgy, Rockford, IL) using a pestle and sample-grinding kit (GE Healthcare Inc., Piscataway, NJ).
p8486
aVAfter homogenization, the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g at 4°C.
p8487
aVWe quantified protein lysate recovered from the residual tissue using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
p8488
aVEqual protein content (40 \u03bcg) was loaded onto precast sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Tris-HCl 4\u201320% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad).
p8489
aVProteins were wet transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight.
p8490
aVThe membrane was blocked at room temperature, and the primary antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4°C.
p8491
aVSecondary antibody and chemilume (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) were added and protein expression was visualized using film exposures.
p8492
aVWe assessed densitometry patterns using Quantity One computer software (Bio-Rad).
p8493
aVWe used positive protein controls purchased from the supplier for the corresponding antibodies and Kaleidoscope Precision Plus protein and prestained SDS-PAGE Broad Range standards (Bio-Rad) to identify the protein of interest.
p8494
aVWe analyzed the time-to-event data [e.g., time-to-first-tumor (latency) and time-to-sacrifice (tumor burden)] using the LIFETEST and LIFEREG procedures in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
p8495
aVWe first estimated survival functions for each group using the Kaplan-Meier method; we then compared these across the three groups using the Wilcoxon log-rank test, and parametrically using survival regression analysis (Collette 2003).
p8496
aVThose animals that had not developed a tumor by the end of the study or that were sacrificed were censored, with either the sacrifice time or the end of study treated as censoring times.
p8497
aVWe analyzed tumor multiplicity data with the GENMOD (generalized linear models) procedure in SAS using generalized Poisson regression on the tumor appearance rates (assuming a negative binomial distribution) (McCullagh and Nelder 1989).
p8498
aVBecause there was a positive correlation between number of tumors and number of days in the study,
p8499
aVwe performed the tests on multiplicity after adjusting for the number of days each animal was in the study.
p8500
aVValues for multiplicity are expressed as mean ± SE.
p8501
aVFor cell proliferation and apoptosis, the resulting values (stained vs. unstained cells) were used to construct a contingency table.
p8502
aVWe tested Western blots for equal variance using a two-sample F-test, and we used the appropriate (assuming equal or unequal variance) two-sample t-test.
p8503
aVWe considered p-values \u2264 0.05 to be statistically significant.
p8504
aVFemale rats in the BPA 25 and BPA 250 groups had similar body weights compared with the SO group at 2, 7, 14, 21, 35, 50, and 100 days of age.
p8505
aVPuberty, as measured by the age at vaginal opening, was not significantly altered, occurring on days 31.39 ± 0.24, 31.15 ± 0.21, and 31.88 ± 0.14 for SO, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups, respectively.
p8506
aVAt 50 days of age, serum 17\u03b2-estradiol concentration was 34.4 ± 2.7 and 23.6 ± 4.7 pg/mL for the SO and BPA 250 groups, respectively.
p8507
aVCirculating progesterone concentrations were 12.5 ± 2.8 and 9.9 ± 1.9 ng/mL in 50-day-old rats in the SO and BPA 250 groups, respectively.
p8508
aVNeither of these findings was significantly different.
p8509
aVWe investigated estrous cyclicity in adult female offspring from all three treatment groups for 19 consecutive days, starting at 7\u20138 weeks of age, and found no significant difference.
p8510
aVFemale rats in the SO, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups gavaged at day 50 with DMBA exhibited a BPA dose-dependent increase in mammary tumors: 2.84 ± 0.31, 3.82 ± 0.43, and 5.00 ± 0.88 mammary tumors per rat, respectively (Figure 1).
p8511
aVAfter adjusting for the length of time on the study (time before sacrifice), we found that the BPA 250 group had a significantly greater number of tumors per rat than did the control group (p = 0.004).
p8512
aVTreatment with BPA also significantly reduced tumor latency, with median tumor latencies of 65, 53 (p = 0.058), and 56.5 (p = 0.025) days for 0, BPA 25, and BPA 250, respectively.
p8513
aVAlthough the BPA 25 group had a similar decrease in latency and an increase in tumor multiplicity (p = 0.131), neither of these changes reached statistical significance.
p8514
aVHistopathologic evaluation of these tumors revealed no changes in the carcinoma score, tumor burden, or length of time in the study for any treatment group (data not shown).
p8515
aVPrevious reports have shown that exposure to BPA during the perinatal period through subcutaneously implanted pumps can lead to long-lasting effects on cell turnover (Durando et al.
p8516
aV2007; Munoz-de-Toro et al.
p8517
aV2005).
p8518
aVTherefore, we assessed the rate of cellular proliferation and apoptosis in the structure most susceptible to mammary carcinogenesis, the TEB.
p8519
aVInterestingly, cell proliferation in TEBs of 50-day-old but not 21-day-old rats was significantly increased in those animals lactationally exposed to BPA 250 (p &lt; 0.001; Figure 2).
p8520
aVEqually important, apoptosis was significantly decreased in the mammary gland of 50-day-old but not 21-day-old BPA 250 rats (p= 0.001).
p8521
aVBecause of the statistically significant decrease in apoptosis in adult BPA 250 rats,
p8522
aVwe measured the expression of several proteins commonly linked to apoptosis.
p8523
aVAt 50 days of age, Akt (p = 0.001) and pAkt (p = 0.050) were significantly different between exposure groups, with each protein showing nearly a 2-fold increase over control expression levels [Figure 3; see also Supplemental Material, Figure 1 (available online at http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/11751/suppl.pdf)].
p8524
aVExpressions of Bad, phosphorylated Bad, Bcl-2, caspase 2, caspase 3, and caspase 9 were not significantly different.
p8525
aVFurthermore, none of these proteins was differentially regulated at 21 days of age,
p8526
aVsuggesting that protein expression and activity of Akt were latent effects from BPA exposure.
p8527
aVGiven the statistically significant increase in cell proliferation in mammary TEBs of 50-day-old offspring exposed lactationally to BPA,
p8528
aVwe assessed proteins implicated in cellular proliferation.
p8529
aVPrimarily because of BPA\u2019s reported weakly estrogenic effects, we initially focused on sex steroid receptors.
p8530
aVWe found that BPA-exposed females exhibited an up-regulation of PR-A of 54% compared with control [p = 0.02; Figure 4; see Supplemental Material, Figure 1 (http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/11751/suppl.pdf)].
p8531
aVBecause PR-A is a known downstream target of estrogen signaling,
p8532
aVwe also assessed the expression of coregulator proteins known to play a role in increased estrogen signaling and breast cancer.
p8533
aVWe found all three members of the p160 family of SRC proteins, SRC-1 (p = 0.001), SRC-2 (p = 0.003), and SRC-3 (p &lt; 0.001), to be significantly up-regulated in response to lactational exposure to BPA [Figure 4; see also Supplemental Material, Figure 1 (http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/11751/suppl.pdf)].
p8534
aVFinally, a correlation has been documented between SRC expression and expression of the erbB family of tyrosine kinases.
p8535
aVAlthough we noted no significant differences for erbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) or erbB2 (neu), we found a significant increase in erbB3 expression (p= 0.01).
p8536
aVWe report for the first time that oral exposure of rats to BPA via lactating dams significantly reduced tumor latency and increased tumor multiplicity in offspring in a dose-dependent manner in a DMBA model of rodent mammary carcinogenesis.
p8537
aVIn the design of these studies to determine if BPA would predispose for mammary cancer, our first considerations were model, route and timing of exposure, and dose.
p8538
aVAlthough no model is perfect, we chose rats because of the reasonable similarity in mammary gland development and use of the chemically induced mammary cancer model for tumorigenesis studies (Russo IH and Russo 1978; Russo et al.
p8539
aV1990).
p8540
aVBecause humans are exposed to BPA primarily by ingestion, we treated rats orally as opposed to injections or subcutaneous implants.
p8541
aVThis takes into consideration metabolism and disposition.
p8542
aVBecause timing of exposure is important to target organ toxicity and mechanism of action, we selected the neonatal/prepubertal period for these studies.
p8543
aVIn choosing the doses, we took into consideration a) the reports of estimated exposures of preschool children BPA at 52\u201374 ng/kg bw/day (Wilson et al.
p8544
aV2007); b) that the European Commission estimated BPA exposure in infants (3\u20136 months of age) at 0.2\u20138.3 \u03bcg/kg bw/day (European Food Safety Authority 2006); and c) that the European Union estimated exposure in infants (1\u20136 months of age) at 7\u20138 \u03bcg/kg bw/day (European Commission 2003).
p8545
aVAccordingly, we chose to treat the dams with a low dose of BPA (25 \u03bcg/kg bw/day, 50% of the U.S. EPA\u2019s daily oral reference dose of 50 \u03bcg/kg bw/day) and a dose that was 10-fold higher than the low dose (250 \u03bcg/kg/day).
p8546
aVFurthermore, we exposed the offspring to significantly less BPA than the dose administered to the dams because of dilution factors resulting from maternal and fetal metabolism and disposition, lactation, and number of offspring.
p8547
aVAlthough the actual blood and tissue concentrations have yet to be determined in our animals, we surmise that the effects reported in the present study are a result of low exposures to BPA.
p8548
aVLikewise, it is possible that the effects of BPA could be on the dam, which could alter hormones and composition of the milk and consequently the offspring, issues that we have not investigated.
p8549
aVOur mammary cancer findings are supported by other in vivo studies.
p8550
aVDurando et al.
p8551
aV(2007) showed that prenatal exposure to BPA (via an osmotic pump, which equates to subcutaneous administration) coupled to a subcarcinogenic dose of N-nitroso-N-methylurea resulted in an increased percentage of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the mammary gland.
p8552
aVSimilarly, Murray et al.
p8553
aV(2007) found that exposure to BPA during the prenatal period through an osmotic pump resulted in the development of carcinoma in situ in the mammary gland even in the absence of an additional carcinogen.
p8554
aVAlthough these studies used different periods of exposure, route of administration, and end point, they still provide support for our findings and add to the growing literature that implicates a detrimental role for early BPA exposure in mammary cancer susceptibility.
p8555
aVOur cell proliferation and apoptosis studies showed that no significant effects stemmed from direct BPA exposure (at 21 days of age).
p8556
aVHowever, delayed effects did occur.
p8557
aVAt 50 days of age, &gt; 4 weeks after discontinuing treatment with BPA, cell proliferation was significantly increased, and apoptosis was significantly decreased, in the mammary glands of rats lactationally exposed to BPA.
p8558
aVFemales lactationally exposed to BPA had a proliferation to apoptosis ratio twice that of control rats in the structures most susceptible to carcinogenesis in the mammary gland, the TEBs (Russo J and Russo 1978).
p8559
aVSubsequent Western blotting analysis revealed that a key regulator of apoptosis, Akt and the biologically active pAkt, was significantly up-regulated.
p8560
aVThese findings were not unexpected given that both prenatal and perinatal exposures to BPA in rodents (via osmotic pumps) have been reported to cause decreased apoptosis in the mammary gland (Durando et al.
p8561
aV2007; Munoz-de-Toro et al.
p8562
aV2005).
p8563
aVWith the balance of cell turnover disrupted so severely, such a situation could provide an environment more susceptible to exposure to a secondary carcinogen, such as DMBA.
p8564
aVThe significant increase in proliferation observed in our study, but not in other studies, may be a function of differing BPA exposure schemes or routes of administration (i.e., postnatal vs. prenatal exposures, oral administration vs. subcutaneous implants, dose, etc.)
p8565
aVthat can affect metabolism and disposition.
p8566
aVBy most accounts, BPA\u2019s mechanism of action is thought to revolve around its weak estrogenic activity.
p8567
aVHence, we evaluated the effects of lactational exposure to BPA on sex steroid receptors in the mammary gland using Western blot analysis.
p8568
aVAlthough we observed no significant change for ER-\u03b1 or PR-B, we observed a significant increase for PR-A.
p8569
aVThis finding is supported by the work of Munoz-de-Toro et al.
p8570
aV(2005), who found an increased percentage of cells expressing PR in the mammary gland after perinatal BPA treatment.
p8571
aVPR has been highly implicated in breast cancer by functioning as the nuclear receptor for the sex hormone progesterone.
p8572
aVRecent work has indicated that the two isoforms of PR function in distinct manners and are induced by differing stimuli.
p8573
aVPR-A is the predominant isoform expressed in the pubertal, virgin mammary gland and is vital to side branching (Aupperlee et al.
p8574
aV2005).
p8575
aVStudies of transgenic mice engineered to overexpress PR-A have demonstrated abnormalities in the mammary gland, including the development of hyperplastic lesions with a disorganized basement membrane and reduced cell-to-cell adhesion (Shyamala et al.
p8576
aV1998).
p8577
aVInterestingly, PR-A has also been reported to be induced by estradiol in Sprague Dawley rats (Kariagina et al.
p8578
aV2007).
p8579
aVTo ensure that increased expression of PR-A was not a result of lactational BPA causing increased concentrations of circulating estradiol, we measured hormone concentrations in rats at 50 days of age.
p8580
aVWe found no significant difference between the BPA-exposed and control groups, confirming that sex hormone concentrations were not altered by lactational BPA exposure.
p8581
aVHowever, no significant changes that we observed manifested before the onset of puberty.
p8582
aVOne potential explanation is that early exposure to BPA increased the sensitivity of the mammary gland to the hormones of puberty.
p8583
aVWe found increased cell proliferation and PR-A expression coupled with decreased apoptosis long after the original exposure to BPA ceased.
p8584
aVIt is possible that early BPA exposure imprints or sensitizes the rat to the effects of postpubertal hormone.
p8585
aVThen, as the concentrations of circulating sex hormones increase postpubertally, the indirect effects of BPA manifest.
p8586
aVThis theory has recently been suggested by Wadia et al.
p8587
aV(2007), who showed that ovariectomized CD-1 mice prenatally exposed to BPA displayed a significantly heightened response in the mammary gland after an estrogenic stimulus.
p8588
aVA potential mechanism involved in a heightened response to estrogen is through SRC proteins.
p8589
aVSRCs function to accelerate hormone-bound nuclear-receptor\u2013induced transcription through weak histone acetyltransferase activity and by recruiting chromatin modification enzymes to the promoter/enhancer regions of target genes.
p8590
aVThe endogenous milieu of coregulator proteins in the target tissue are thought to have great impact on the activation of nuclear receptors, such as ER and PR, and be the basis of chemotherapeutic resistance and tissue-specific function of selective ER modulators (Schiff et al.
p8591
aV2003).
p8592
aVWe found the expression of the p160 family of SRC proteins (SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3) to be dramatically increased at 50 days of age after lactational exposure to BPA.
p8593
aVDescriptions of SRC activity, as reported through transgenic mouse models, provide a close correlation with many of the reported effects of early exposure to BPA.
p8594
aVAlterations in morphology, such as decreased side branching, decreased ductal elongation, and increased alveologenesis, have been reported in mice deficient in SRC-1 and SRC-3 (Xu et al.
p8595
aV1998, 2000).
p8596
aVIt seems plausible that increased expression of the SRCs in the mammary glands, as reported in our study, would confer a greater incidence of side branching and alveologenesis.
p8597
aVIndeed, mice overexpressing SRC-3/AIB1 showed a greater degree of ductal branching (Torres-Arzayus et al.
p8598
aV2004).
p8599
aVThree independent reports on early BPA exposure have described similar morphologic abnormalities, such as increased side branching and alveologenesis, in the mammary gland (Markey et al.
p8600
aV2001, 2005; Munoz-de-Toro et al.
p8601
aV2005).
p8602
aVKnocking out SRC-3/AIB1 in mice has been shown to confer resistance to DMBA-induced mammary cancer, resulting in an increased tumor latency, reduced multiplicity, and slower growth rate (Kuang et al.
p8603
aV2005).
p8604
aVOur results demonstrate that lactational BPA exposure results in a significant increase in DMBA-induced mammary cancer susceptibility at a time when the local environment of the mammary gland has drastically up-regulated expression of all of the SRCs.
p8605
aVLikewise, transgenic mice engineered to overexpress SRC-3 exhibit an increased susceptibility to mammary cancer, developing mammary hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and malignant tumor formation after a long latency period (Torres-Arzayus et al.
p8606
aV2004).
p8607
aVPrenatal BPA has been shown to cause an increase in premalignant and/or malignant lesions in the mammary glands of rats during adulthood when given alone or in concert with a sub-carcinogenic dose of N-nitroso-N-methylurea (Durando et al.
p8608
aV2007; Murray et al.
p8609
aV2007).
p8610
aVSRC-3/AIB1-deficient mice also show reduced Akt activity, whereas SRC-3/AIB1\u2013over-expressing mice show increased Akt activation and reduction in apoptosis in the mammary gland and in mammary tumors (Kuang et al.
p8611
aV2005; Torres-Arzayus et al.
p8612
aV2004).
p8613
aVWe report here that lactational BPA is able to up-regulate Akt expression/activation and down-regulate apoptosis in the mammary gland during adulthood.
p8614
aVFinally, Xu et al.
p8615
aV(2007) described perinatal exposure to BPA in Sprague Dawley rats causing a significant increase in SRC-1 mRNA and protein in the hippocampus of male pups.
p8616
aVA relationship has been established in the literature between the SRCs, HER2/erbB2, and the Akt signaling pathway.
p8617
aVOne study reported SRC-1 to be overexpressed in 46% of HER2-positive breast tumors but in only 6% of HER2-negative breast tumors (Fleming et al.
p8618
aV2004).
p8619
aVBouras et al.
p8620
aV(2001) reported a positive correlation between the expression of SRC-3, HER2, and p53.
p8621
aVAlthough HER2 breast tumors are frequently cited as resulting in shorter disease-free survival, coupling HER2 overexpression with SRC-3 overexpression has been reported to worsen the prognosis further, adding a greater risk of refractory disease (Kirkegaard et al.
p8622
aV2007; Mc Ilroy et al.
p8623
aV2006; Osborne et al.
p8624
aV2003).
p8625
aVSRC-3/AIB1 has also been shown to control the activity of both erbB1 and HER2 (erbB2) (Lahusen et al.
p8626
aV2007).
p8627
aVDown-regulating erbB3 through small interfering RNA reduces Akt activity (Liu et al.
p8628
aV2007).
p8629
aVThese results suggest that coactivator proteins may serve as essential mediator proteins, linking crosstalk between growth factors and sex steroid signaling pathways.
p8630
aVAlthough we noted no changes between treatment groups in the expression of erbB1, erbB2, or erbB4, we found a significant up-regulation for erbB3.
p8631
aVerbB3, despite lacking a catalytic domain, has been reported to be the preferred dimerization partner for erbB2.
p8632
aVThis pairing has also been reported to induce the most mitogenic response that preferentially signals through the Akt pathway (Karamouzis et al.
p8633
aV2007).
p8634
aVAlthough overexpression of erbB3 alone may induce mammary carcinogenesis, overexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3 has been observed frequently in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses the wild-type erbB2 protein, and in human breast tumor samples (Karamouzis et al.
p8635
aV2007).
p8636
aVThis dual over-expression has been linked to more aggressive disease and increased development of drug-resistant cancer.
p8637
aVThus, although we did not observe the up-regulation of erbB2 at this specific time point (50 days of age), an up-regulation of erbB3 could provide ample access to a binding partner for erbB2 and provide a local environment more prone for cancer development.
p8638
aVThe data we present here provide the first evidence that maternal exposure to BPA during lactation decreased time to first tumor latency and increased the number of DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female offspring.
p8639
aVWe conclude that increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis at the time of DMBA administration play a vital role in BPA\u2019s mechanism of action.
p8640
aVFurthermore, we believe that these effects are, at least in part, mediated through the increased expression of erbB3 and the p160 family of SRCs (SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3/AIB1) and increased Akt activity.
p8641
aVInterestingly, the published observations of early exposure to BPA overlap well with the reported phenotypes of transgenic mouse models of SRC overexpression and counter models of SRC deficiency.
p8642
aVHowever, not only do the alterations reported here provide an explanation of enhanced mammary carcinogenesis after lactational treatment with BPA, but they also warn of the potential for developing more aggressive and refractory forms of breast cancer.
p8643
aVIn coculturing nonmalignant, random periareolar fine-needle aspirates from the contra-lateral breast of women with breast cancer, Dairkee et al.
p8644
aV(2008) found that physiologic doses of estrogen and progesterone coupled to BPA produced a gene signature profile that was associated with breast tumors with high pathologic grade, greater tumor size, and shorter disease-free patient survival.
p8645
aVIncreased expression of erbB2, erbB3, the SRCs, and Akt activation and have been linked with tamoxifen resistance (Bouras et al.
p8646
aV2001; Kirkegaard et al.
p8647
aV2007; Mc Ilroy et al.
p8648
aV2006; Osborne et al.
p8649
aV2003).
p8650
aVIn breast cancer patients, high SRC-3/AIB1 expression is associated with HER2 overexpression, tamoxifen resistance, and higher mortality.
p8651
aVIf these effects found in rodents carry over to humans, even small, seemingly harmless exposures of BPA early in life could be detrimental and play a role in increased breast cancer susceptibility as well as the ability of a tumor to become resistant to therapy.
p8652
aVPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may increase breast cancer risk, and the association may be modified by inherited differences in deactivation of PAH intermediates by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs).
p8653
aVFew breast cancer studies have investigated the joint effects of multiple GSTs and a PAH biomarker.
p8654
aVWe estimated the breast cancer risk associated with multiple polymorphisms in the GST gene (GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1) and the interaction with PAH\u2013DNA adducts and cigarette smoking.
p8655
aVWe conducted unconditional logistic regression using data from a population-based sample of women (cases/controls, respectively): GST polymorphisms were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight assays (n = 926 of 916), PAH\u2013DNA adduct blood levels were measured by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n = 873 of 941), and smoking status was assessed by in-person questionnaires (n = 943 of 973).
p8656
aVOdds ratios for joint effects on breast cancer risk among women with at least three variant alleles were 1.56 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13\u20132.16] for detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.56\u20131.56) for no detectable adducts; corresponding odds ratios for three or more variants were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.82\u20131.69) for ever smokers and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.97\u20132.14) for never smokers.
p8657
aVNeither interaction was statistically significant (p = 0.43 and 0.62, respectively).
p8658
aVWe found little statistical evidence that PAHs interacted with GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTA1 polymorphisms to further increase breast cancer risk.
p8659
aVPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an environmentally ubiquitous class of compounds that are formed during incomplete combustion of organic substances.
p8660
aVSeveral PAHs have been classified as probable human carcinogens (Boffetta et al.
p8661
aV1997; Shimada 2006).
p8662
aVIn the general population, the major source of exposure is tobacco smoke (Lioy and Greenberg 1990), with diet (grilled/smoked foods, cereals, and leafy green vegetables) and exposure to fossil fuel combustion by-products contributing to cumulative exposure (Waldman et al.
p8663
aV1991).
p8664
aVAlthough there is strong evidence for the relationship between PAH exposure and lung, skin, and bladder cancer in humans, it is equivocal as to whether PAH exposure is associated with breast cancer (Boffetta et al.
p8665
aV1997; Gammon and Santella 2008; Shimada 2006).
p8666
aVPAH\u2013DNA adducts reflect not only PAH exposure but also the body\u2019s ability to metabolize these compounds.
p8667
aVThe formation of these carcinogen\u2013DNA adducts is recognized as a key event in the initiation of carcinogenesis (Gammon et al.
p8668
aV2004b; Hecht 2003; Wogan et al.
p8669
aV2004).
p8670
aVIn the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP), a large population-based case\u2013control study, blood levels of PAH\u2013DNA adducts were associated with a modest 29\u201335% elevation in breast cancer risk among women (Gammon et al 2004b).
p8671
aVThese findings are consistent with previously conducted, smaller hospital-based studies (Li et al.
p8672
aV1996, 2002; Rundle et al.
p8673
aV2000a).
p8674
aVAnimal studies have provided further support for the role of PAHs as mammary carcinogens (Cavalieri et al.
p8675
aV1991; el-Bayoumy et al.
p8676
aV1995).
p8677
aVAlthough a significant association between breast cancer risk and detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts has been noted, a dose\u2013response relationship was not observed in the LIBCSP.
p8678
aVFurther stratification by known sources of PAH exposure, such as cigarette smoking or the consumption of PAH-containing foods, did not modify this association (Gammon et al.
p8679
aV2004b).
p8680
aVThese findings are consistent with those from smaller studies (Hu et al.
p8681
aV2007).
p8682
aVThe lack of a dose response effect suggests that there may be subgroups of women who are more genetically susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of PAH exposure on breast tissue.
p8683
aVInherited differences in the metabolism of PAHs, interindividual differences in enzyme expression, and induction may be key determinants in individual breast cancer susceptibility (Shimada 2006).
p8684
aVGenetic differences in metabolic activation and detoxification of PAHs have been shown to affect differences in phenotypic biomarkers such as urinary metabolites and are hypothesized to influence cancer risk (Brescia et al.
p8685
aV2004; Hatsukami et al.
p8686

aV2002; Upadhyaya et al.
p8689
aV2006; Wogan et al.
p8690
aV2004).
p8691
aVFurther investigation of these genetic differences in the deactivation of PAH metabolites may contribute to our understanding of the lack of a dose\u2013response relationship and increased understanding of breast cancer risk.
p8692
aVThe phase II metabolic super family of GST enzymes is involved in the metabolic activation and deactivation of PAH metabolites, and polymorphisms in these genes lead to specific changes in enzyme function and the capacity to metabolize PAH compounds (Hecht 1999).
p8693
aVThe GSTM1 null polymorphism [GenBank BC036805; National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 2009a] results in the absence of isoenzyme (mu) expression and reduced glutathione binding efficiency of PAH epoxides and other genotoxic substrates (Hayes and Pulford 1995).
p8694
aVThe GSTP 1le105Val polymorphism [GSTP1; Unigene Hs.523836 (NCBI 2009b)] is associated with reduced isoenzyme (pi) expression and a reduced capacity to inactivate carcinogens, including the diol epoxides created during phase I metabolism of PAHs (Coles and Kadlubar 2003; Pavanello and Clonfero 2000; Ryberg et al.
p8695
aV1997; Watson et al.
p8696
aV1998).
p8697
aVThe GSTT1 null polymorphism (Genbank X79389) results in the absence of (theta) isoenzyme (Hayes and Pulford 1995), but the role of this polymorphism in relation to PAH metabolism is uncertain (Pavanello and Clonfero 2000).
p8698
aVOn the one hand, the theta isoenzyme is thought to activate alkylating agents, such as nitrosamines present in tobacco smoke (Hecht 1999; Pavanello and Clonfero 2000); on the other hand, in human erythrocytes, the theta isoenzyme binds reactive conjugates to glutathione, inhibiting genotoxic damage to DNA (Pelin et al.
p8699
aV1996).

aVGSTs conjugate PAH diol epoxides into water-soluble products, and GST enzymes also protect against products of oxidative stress (Mitrunen and Hirvonen 2003).
p8701
aVGSTA1 (Unigene Hs.
p8702
aV446309) is thought to decrease reactive oxygen species and, via an increase in antioxidant levels, to also play an active role in PAH metabolism (Ahn et al.
p8703
aV2006; Coles et al.
p8704
aV2005; Korashy and El-Kadi 2006).
p8705
aVFor GSTA1, two alleles, hGSTA1*A and hGSTA1*B, differ in three linked base changes in the 5\u2032 promoter region of the gene: T\u2192G at nucleotide 567, C\u2192T at nucleotide 69, and G\u2192A at nucleotide 52 (Coles et al 2001a, 2001b).
p8706
aVThese substitutions result in differential expression (Coles et al.
p8707
aV2001b), with lower transcriptional activation with GSTA1*B (variant) than with GSTA1*A (common) alleles.
p8708
aVIt has been demonstrated by our group that the variant GSTA1*B/B genotype is associated with higher risk of breast cancer among smokers compared with nonsmokers with the A/A* genotype (Ahn et al.
p8709
aV2006).
p8710
aVOnly one breast cancer study (Rundle et al.
p8711
aV2000b) has reported on a potential interaction between GSTM1 null genotype and PAH\u2013DNA adducts.
p8712
aVHowever, the sample size was small (&lt; 100 cases), yielding unstable effect estimates and prohibiting exploration of more than one single nucleotide polymorphism from among the many that contribute to this complex cascade of activation and detoxification.
p8713
aVInvestigating whether genetically determined differences in multiple GST genotypes modify the association between breast cancer risk and PAH exposure may improve our ability to identify women who are susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of PAHs on breast tissue.
p8714
aVThe goal of our present analysis was to investigate whether multiple GST polymorphisms modified the relationship between PAH exposure and breast cancer,
p8715
aVusing the lymphocyte PAH\u2013DNA adduct biomarker as our primary exposure measure of interest using a large, population-based sample of cases and controls from the LIBCSP.
p8716
aVWe also evaluated the interaction between GST polymorphisms and smoking status,
p8717
aVbecause smoking behavior was previously identified as the strongest predictor of detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts (Shantakumar et al.
p8718
aV2005).
p8719
aVFinally, we investigated the joint effects of smoking status and GST polymorphisms on detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts among control women.
p8720
aVThe population-based sample of cases and controls from the LIBCSP has been described previously (Gammon et al.
p8721
aV2002a).
p8722
aVBriefly, cases were defined as English-speaking adult women newly diagnosed with breast cancer residing in Nassau County or Suffolk County in Long Island, New York.
p8723
aVPopulation-based controls were identified through random-digit dialing for women &lt; 65 years of age, and by Health Care Finance rosters for women \u2265 65 years of age within the same counties, and frequency matched them (by 5-year age groups) to cases.
p8724
aVParticipants were between 20 and 98 years of age; 94% were white, 4% were black, and 2% other races/ethnicities.
p8725
aVThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the collaborating institutions, and written informed consent was obtained from the LIBCSP participants.
p8726
aVRespondents to the case\u2013control interview included 1,508 cases and 1,556 controls (Gammon et al.
p8727
aV2002a).
p8728
aVThe 2-hr in-person structured interview collected data on history of cigarette smoking (current, past), exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the residential home throughout the life course (Gammon et al.
p8729
aV2004a), and other characteristics potentially relevant to breast cancer risk.
p8730
aVBlood samples were obtained from 73% of cases and 73% of controls (Gammon et al.
p8731
aV2004b).
p8732
aVWe processed the blood samples collected by Gammon et al.
p8733
aV(2004b), isolated the DNA and completed genotyping for GSTT1 and GSTM1 as previously described (Steck et al.
p8734
aV2007b), by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction method as previously described (Bell et al.
p8735
aV1992).
p8736
aVGenotyping for GSTP1 (Ile105Val; rs1695) (Steck et al.
p8737
aV2007b) and GSTA1 (Ahn et al.
p8738
aV2006) was completed as previously described by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight assay (Fannon 2002).
p8739
aVWe included positive and negative controls in each batch, and a random 10% repeated sampling yielded a 97% concordance.
p8740
aVGenotype distributions of GSTA1 (p = 0.81) and GSTP1 (p = 0.38) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among controls.
p8741
aVThe number of cases and controls, respectively, for whom genotyping was successful varied with genotype (n = 1,041 and 1,090 for GSTA1, 983 and 1,016 for GSTT1, 975 and 1,001 for GSTM1, and 1,027 and 1,069 for GSTP1).
p8742
aVMissing genotype data were primarily due to insufficient DNA (Ahn et al.
p8743
aV2006; Steck et al.
p8744
aV2007b).
p8745
aVPAH\u2013DNA adducts were measured in peripheral mononuclear cell DNA using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (Gammon et al.
p8746
aV2002b).
p8747
aVPAH\u2013DNA adduct measurements were available for 873 cases and 941 controls who donated sufficient blood volume for the assay, as described previously (Gammon et al.
p8748
aV2004b).
p8749
aVWe calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression using SAS version 9.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
p8750
aVAll models were adjusted for age at reference (date of diagnosis for cases and date of identification for controls), the frequency-matching factor.
p8751
aVCovariates considered as potential confounders included race, family history of breast cancer, parity, age at menarche, age at first pregnancy, menopausal status, lifetime alcohol intake, education, and smoking status.
p8752
aVWe considered a covariate a confounder and included it in the models if it changed the ORs by more than 10% (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989);
p8753
aVhowever, adjustment by these potential confounders did not appreciably change the ORs, and therefore only the age-adjusted estimates are shown.
p8754
aVFor our first set of analyses, our goal was to determine whether breast cancer risk is associated with the GST polymorphisms and whether they interact with PAH exposures, either alone or jointly, to affect breast cancer risk.
p8755
aVWe previously reported that the ORs for the association between breast cancer and individual GST genotypes were not substantially elevated (Ahn et al.
p8756
aV2006; Steck et al.
p8757
aV2007b), although risk was elevated when we considered multiple GSTs (Ahn et al.
p8758
aV2006; Steck et al 2007b).
p8759
aVHere, we focus primarily on the analyses that examine the interaction of GSTs with adducts and smoking, using the following methods.
p8760
aVWe estimated the ORs for breast cancer in relation to potential interactions between various PAH measures and the GST polymorphisms, a) considering each polymorphism separately (Table 1), and (b) by grouping individuals based on the number of variant alleles for any of the four GST polymorphisms considered (Tables 2 and 3).
p8761
aVFor this group of analyses, the reference group included women with GSTT1 present, GSTM1 present, GSTP1 common (AG or GG), or GSTA1 common (A/A*) genotypes.
p8762
aVUsing this approach, we explored the effect of even a single at-risk genotype, among those who carried common alleles for the other GSTs considered.
p8763
aVWe chose to group the genes this way based on experimental evidence indicating reduced or no enzyme activity for the variant and null genotypes.
p8764
aVIn terms of metabolism, the GSTP1 valine genotype is thought to be associated with lower glutathione S-transferase pi enzyme activity compared with the GSTP1 isoleucine genotype, which plays a key role in the detoxification of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, a major carcinogen present in tobacco smoke (Fields et al.
p8765
aV1998; Hecht 1999; Nakajima et al.
p8766
aV1995).
p8767
aVTo explore these potential gene\u2013PAH interactions, we developed separate models for women based on the presence or absence of the PAH exposure measure [PAH\u2013DNA adducts (detectable/not detectable); self-reported cigarette smoking status (ever/never, or current/past/never)] or pack years of smoking history (&lt; 15 years, 15\u201330 years, &gt; 30 years).
p8768
aVWe also developed models for all women that included multiplicative interaction terms (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989); gene\u2013environment interactions were formally assessed by examining departures from multiplicity by comparing models with and without the interaction term using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989).
p8769
aVIn addition, we investigated potential interactions on the additive scale (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989) using joint indicator terms for genotype only, for PAH measure only, and for both genotype and PAH measure (Tables 3 and 4).
p8770
aVInteraction contrast ratios (ICRs) and their 95% CIs were calculated to measure the relative excess risk due to interaction (Assmann et al.
p8771
aV1996; Rothman and Greenland 1998).
p8772
aVWe also considered other categorizations of smoking exposure status that incorporated information collected by the questionnaire on environmental tobacco smoke (Gammon et al.
p8773
aV2004a),
p8774
aVbut the cell sizes were too small to yield meaningful results, so we do not show these data.
p8775
aVFor our second set of analyses, our goal was to determine the association between PAH\u2013DNA adducts and the GST variant alleles among control women only.
p8776
aVWe used unconditional logistic regression with detectable adducts as the dependent variable, and GSTs as the independent variable, controlling for age at reference and season of blood draw (Table 4).
p8777
aVWe also investigated the main effect of each genotype or number of variant alleles on the outcome of detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts in a multivariate model adjusted for age, smoking status, and season of blood draw.
p8778
aVIn a previous study (Shantakumar et al.
p8779
aV2005), we found that cigarette smoking was a significant predictor of detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts among this population-based sample;
p8780
aVthus, we also explored whether the GST genotypes modified the association between smoking status and detectable adducts.
p8781
aVWe also considered potential interactions with cigarette smoke because of its link to our biomarker, although we recognize that other PAH sources and other constituents of tobacco smoke could potentially interact with GST polymorphisms to affect risk; however, these other constituents of tobacco smoke have not been linked to breast cancer risk in a human study.
p8782
aVAs shown in Tables 1 and 2, we did not observe substantial effect modification, on a multiplicative or additive scale, by any of the individual genotypes on the associations between breast cancer risk and PAH exposure (PAH\u2013DNA adducts or cigarette smoking).
p8783
aVThe ORs for the association between breast cancer risk and multiple GST variant alleles were 1.10 (95% CI, 0.77\u20131.57) for three or more variants, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.56\u20131.03) for two variants, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.59\u20131.08) for one variant.
p8784
aVWhen we considered the combined effects of GSTM1, -P1, -T1, and -A1 variants that are coded based on their PAH-related biologic activity (rather than for their isothiocyanate-related activity), we did not find a significant association between the number of variant GST alleles and breast cancer risk.
p8785
aVTable 3 illustrates the potential joint effects of PAH\u2013DNA adducts and the number of GST polymorphisms (one, two, or three or more variants) and breast cancer risk.
p8786
aVWe observed a 56% increase in risk (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13\u20132.16) among women with detectable adducts and three or more GST variants [GSTT1 null variant, GSTM1 null variant, GSTP1 AG/GG genotype, GSTA1 common (A*/B* or B*/B*) genotypes] compared with those with all common genotypes and no detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts.
p8787
aVThe corresponding OR for three or more variants and no detectable adducts was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.56\u20131.56).
p8788
aVWomen with one variant allele and no detectable adducts had a 44% reduced risk of breast cancer compared with women with all common alleles and no detectable adducts (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40\u20130.77); the corresponding OR for detectable adducts was not significant (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78\u20131.20; Table 3).
p8789
aVAs shown in Table 4, the ORs for the association between breast cancer risk and the number of GST variant alleles varied little with smoking status, and results for interaction on either a multiplicative or additive scale were not statistically significant.
p8790
aVFor example, the OR associated with three or more GST variants was 1.18 among ever smokers (95% CI, 0.82\u20131.69) but was 1.44 among never smokers (95% CI, 0.97\u20132.14).
p8791
aVResults for the interaction between multiple GST variants and pack-years of smoking (data not shown) are similar to those shown in Table 4.
p8792
aVWhen we categorized ever smokers by whether they were current or past smokers, the OR for the association between breast cancer risk and three or more GST variants was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.27\u20131.43) among current smokers, and 1.66 (95% CI, 0.93\u20132.97) among past smokers, compared with never smokers with all four common alleles.
p8793
aVHowever, the category sizes upon which these estimates are based were small (data not shown), and the p-value for the interaction on a multiplicative scale was 0.31.
p8794
aVWe did not observe a significant association between any single GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, or GSTA1 polymorphism and detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts among the control women (GSTT1: OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.77\u20131.56; GSTM1: OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.69\u20131.25; GSTP1: OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72\u20131.27; GSTA1: OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.86\u20131.53) or the number of variant genotypes and detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts (one variant compared with all common alleles: OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.92\u20132.79; two variants compared with all common alleles: OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.77\u20132.36; three or more variants compared with all common alleles: OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.75\u20132.82).
p8795
aVTable 5 shows the association between GST polymorphisms and PAH\u2013DNA adducts among control women stratified by smoking status.
p8796
aVWomen who ever smoked and had the GSTM1 present genotype had a 35% reduced odds (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45\u20130.93) of having detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts compared with never smokers with the same genotype.
p8797
aVWe noted similar results forever smokers with the GSTM1 null genotype compared with never smokers with the GSTM1 common genotype (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43\u20130.93).
p8798
aVEver smokers with the GSTT1 present genotype had a 27% reduced odds of PAH\u2013DNA adducts (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53\u20130.99) compared with never smokers with the same genotype.
p8799
aVEver smokers with the common GSTA1 genotype had a reduced odds of PAH\u2013DNA adducts compared with never smokers with the same genotype (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47\u20130.96; Table 5).
p8800
aVWe found no evidence of effect modification between any of the individual genotypes and smoking status on PAH\u2013DNA adduct status on the multiplicative scale (LRT p-values: GSTT1, 0.20; GSTM1, 0.75; GSTP1, 0.15; GSTA1, 0.40) or on the additive scale.
p8801
aVWe did not find statistical evidence between number of variant alleles and smoking status on the odds of developing detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts on the additive scale (one-variant allele: ICR, 0.28; 95% CI, \u20130.39 to 0.45; two-variant alleles: ICR, \u20130.091; 95% CI, \u20130.57 to 0.38; three or more variant alleles: ICR, 0.177; 95% CI, \u20130.23 to 0.59) or on the multiplicative scale (p-value from the LRT = 0.13).
p8802
aVWhen considering the number of adducts as a continuous outcome (data not shown), we found no evidence of a main effect of the individual genotypes on the number of adducts in an age-adjusted model (GSTT1 p = 0.86, GSTM1 p = 0.54, GSTP1 p = 0.91, GSTA1 p = 0.86).
p8803
aVTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic investigation of breast cancer to consider the joint effects of four GST polymorphisms and several measures of PAH exposure, including a PAH\u2013DNA adduct biomarker.
p8804
aVDespite the biologic plausibility of our hypothesis, we found no strong evidence for an interaction between the number of variant GST alleles with various measures of PAH exposure (including ever/never smoking status, pack-years of smoking, or detected PAH\u2013DNA adducts) and breast cancer risk, nor did we find an association among the control women between number of variant GST polymorphisms and the outcome of detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts.
p8805
aVWe found some evidence for a reduced risk of detectable adducts among control women who were ever smokers regardless of whether they had the GSTM1 deletion polymorphism or the present genotype (Table 5).
p8806
aVWe also report for the first time that among controls with the A*/A* GSTA1 genotype, ever smokers had lower odds of having detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts than did never smokers with the same genotype (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41\u20130.92).
p8807
aVA few previous studies (Helzlsouer et al.
p8808
aV1998; van der Hel et al.
p8809
aV2005) including our own have found that individual polymorphisms in GSTA1 (Ahn et al.
p8810
aV2006), GSTM1 null (Helzlsouer et al.
p8811
aV1998; Spurdle et al.
p8812
aV2007), and GSTT1 null (van der Hel et al.
p8813
aV2005) and GSTP1 (heterozygote or homozygote valine) (Helzlsouer et al.
p8814
aV1998) are modestly associated with breast cancer, although others have reported no association with GSTT1 (García-Closas et al.
p8815
aV1999; Helzlsouer et al, 1998; Vogl et al.
p8816
aV2004), GSTP1 (Vogl et al.
p8817
aV2004), or GSTM1 (Ambrosone et al.
p8818
aV1995; García-Closas et al.
p8819
aV1999; Vogl et al.
p8820
aV2004).
p8821
aVEffects of multiple combinations of GST polymorphisms on breast cancer risk have previously been conducted in smaller studies, with conflicting findings (Helzlsouer et al.
p8822
aV1998; Steck et al.
p8823
aV2007b; van der Hel et al.
p8824
aV2005; Vogl et al.
p8825
aV2004).
p8826
aVCombined effect of all three GSTT1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 variants have been reported to have greater than a 3-fold increase in breast cancer risk compared with women with the common genotype for all three polymorphisms (Helzlsouer et al.
p8827
aV1998; Steck et al.
p8828
aV2007b).
p8829
aVIn this analysis, in which we considered the combined effects of the GSTT1, -M1, -P1, and -A1 variants that are coded based on their PAH-related biologic activity (rather than for their isothiocyanate-related activity), we did not find a significant association between the number of variant GST alleles and breast cancer risk.
p8830
aVPrevious studies have differed on whether GST polymorphisms modify the association between cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk (Millikan et al.
p8831
aV2000; Terry and Goodman 2006; van der Hel et al.
p8832
aV2005; Vogl et al.
p8833
aV2004; Zheng et al.
p8834
aV2002).
p8835
aVSmaller studies have reported that smoking did not modify associations between GSTT1 (Vogl et al.
p8836
aV2004), GSTM1 (van der Hel et al.
p8837
aV2005; Vogl et al.
p8838
aV2004), or GSTP1 polymorphisms (Vogl et al.
p8839
aV2004) and breast cancer, whereas former smokers with GSTT1 null were found to have an increased risk of breast cancer compared with never smokers with GSTT1 present (van der Hel et al.
p8840
aV2005).
p8841
aVFor example, one recent breast cancer meta-analysis reported no interaction between individual GST polymorphisms and smoking, whereas another meta-analysis reported positive associations between breast cancer risk and GSTT1 present and GSTM1 null genotypes among smokers (Terry and Goodman 2006; Vogl et al.
p8842
aV2004).
p8843
aVIn contrast, we observed an increased risk of breast cancer with three or more variant GST alleles in a previous analysis (Steck et al.
p8844
aV2007b), but no increased risk with number of variant alleles as defined by low PAH-metabolizing activity, and no evidence of gene\u2013environment interaction with PAH exposure.
p8845
aVOur present findings are unique in that we investigated four GST polymorphisms simultaneously in a single large study.
p8846
aVTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the interaction between PAH\u2013DNA adducts and individual/combined effects of GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 genotypes on breast cancer risk.
p8847
aVWe found no pronounced adverse effect for the genotype\u2013PAH exposure interaction, regardless of the PAH measure.
p8848
aVGiven that the genetic polymorphisms we examined are known to be functionally associated with deactivation of the active intermediates of PAHs, our findings are not easily interpreted.
p8849
aVIt is possible that the PAH\u2013DNA adduct biomarker effect estimates already reflect any effects associated with metabolic variation; however, if this were true, then any apparent interaction between PAHs and GSTs should have been evident when examining the joint effects with smoking.
p8850
aVWe found a reduction in risk among women with at least one variant allele and no detectable adducts, but we did not find a similar reduction among these same women in relation to no smoking.
p8851
aVThus, we do not report evidence that PAHs interacted with these polymorphisms to further increase risk.
p8852
aVWe acknowledge that expression of GSTs can be modulated by a variety of factors, including diet.
p8853
aVThere is extensive literature on animal studies demonstrating an interaction between isothiocyanates and PAHs on cancer risk, and the induction of phase II enzymes by isothiocyanates (Hecht 1996, 2000).
p8854
aVThe interaction between GSTs and isothiocyanates does not appear to interact to affect breast cancer risk in humans or the variations in the urinary metabolites of isothiocyanates in our data (Steck et al.
p8855
aV2007a, 2007b).
p8856
aVWhether cruciferous vegetable intake would further interact with PAHs and GSTs to affect breast cancer risk is unclear.
p8857
aVUnfortunately, this study was underpowered to explore such three way interactions despite a large sample size.
p8858
aVNevertheless, it may be theoretically possible that breast cancer risk is influenced by a potential three-way interaction of PAH\u2013DNA adducts, GST polymorphisms, and cruciferous vegetable intake, although our current available data do not support this hypothesis (Steck et al.
p8859
aV2007a, 2007b).
p8860
aVWe considered the PAH\u2013DNA adduct outcome as both a continuous and a dichotomous variable (detected/not detected), although the latter may be more informative given the lack of a dose\u2013response relationship between adducts and breast cancer risk (Gammon et al.
p8861
aV2002b).
p8862
aVIn our analyses among control women, individual GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTA1 genotypes were not associated with detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts, nor was the number of variant GST alleles.
p8863
aVEven after stratification on smoking, the number of variant GST alleles was not associated with detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts; however, ever smokers with either the GSTM1 null or GSTM1 present genotype had a reduced risk of detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts (Table 5).
p8864
aVWe observed a similar finding within the strata of ever smokers and the GSTP1 common genotype compared with never smokers with the common genotype.
p8865
aVOur results are the first published findings regarding GSTA1 polymorphisms and PAH\u2013DNA adducts.
p8866
aVOur findings related to polymorphisms in GSTM1 and PAH\u2013DNA adduct formation are in contrast with one study (Rundle et al.
p8867
aV2003),
p8868
aVwhile being consistent with others that report no significant difference in detectable PAH\u2013DNA adducts based on GSTM1 status (Grinberg-Funes et al.
p8869
aV1994; Rothman et al.
p8870
aV1995; Weiserbs et al.
p8871
aV2003).
p8872
aVHowever, the LIBCSP results reported here are based upon a much larger sample size than previous analyses, which yields more stable effect estimates.
p8873
aVAdditionally, we used different methods to measure the PAH\u2013DNA adducts in the various studies, possibly influencing the results.
p8874
aVIn an epidemiologic study, the use of a biomarker of exposure, such as PAH\u2013DNA adducts, is considered superior because exposure assessment is not based on self-report, eliminating concerns for recall bias.
p8875
aVReliability in the measurement of genotype and adducts was high.
p8876
aVMeasurement error was possible, although unlikely with genotyping and analysis of adducts; however, because the laboratory was blinded to status of samples, any measurement error in measuring genotype and of PAH\u2013DNA adduct status was independent of case\u2013control status.
p8877
aVTherefore, any resulting bias would have been nondifferential.
p8878
aVOur study power was limited when we examined interactions within subgroups of women, such as those with PAH\u2013DNA adducts.
p8879
aVHowever, the LIBCSP is the largest study conducted to date with information on PAH\u2013DNA adducts with which to evaluate these associations, and thus our study power was better than that of previously reported studies.
p8880
aVWe selected the GST polymorphisms because of their role in phase II metabolism, specifically metabolism of PAH-reactive intermediates.
p8881
aVBecause PAH\u2013DNA adducts may be related to inherited differences in the metabolism of PAHs, this pathway was hypothesized to be important in individual breast cancer susceptibility.
p8882
aVGSTP1 and GSTM1 have been shown to have a role in detoxification of PAH carcinogenic intermediates produced by cytochrome P450 in phase I metabolism (Butkiewicz et al.
p8883
aV2000).
p8884
aVGSTT1 and GSTA1 have also been implicated in the metabolism of PAH intermediates (Garte et al.
p8885
aV2007; Hayes and Pulford, 1995; Korashy and El-Kadi 2006).
p8886
aVOur previous analyses have shown that breast cancer risk was modestly elevated in relation to PAH\u2013DNA adducts (Gammon et al.
p8887
aV2002b, 2004b), among certain subgroups of smokers (Gammon et al.
p8888
aV2004a), and among women with multiple variant alleles in GST genes (Steck et al.
p8889
aV2007b).
p8890
aVIn this analysis, however, we did not find strong evidence for further elevation of breast cancer risk, either on a multiplicative or on an additive scale, when we considered the joint effect of multiple GSTs and PAHs (cigarette smoking or PAH\u2013DNA adducts), despite the biologic plausibility of such an interaction.
p8891
aVThese findings are based upon the largest population-based study of breast cancer conducted to date with a biomarker of PAH exposure.
p8892
aVFurther study may be warranted incorporating other biologic measures of PAH metabolism.

aVInhalative exposure to vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) causes lung cancer in rodents.
p8894
aVThe aim of the study was to investigate the impact of V2O5 on DNA stability in workers from a V2O5 factory.
p8895
aVWe determined DNA strand breaks in leukocytes of 52 workers and controls using the alkaline comet assay.
p8896
aVWe also investigated different parameters of chromosomal instability in lymphocytes of 23 workers and 24 controls using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) cytome method.
p8897
aVSeven of eight biomarkers were increased in blood cells of the workers, and vanadium plasma concentrations in plasma were 7-fold higher than in the controls (0.31 \u03bcg/L).
p8898
aVWe observed no difference in DNA migration under standard conditions, but we found increased tail lengths due to formation of oxidized purines (7%) and pyrimidines (30%) with lesion-specific enzymes (formamidopyrimidine glycosylase and endonuclease III) in the workers.
p8899
aVBleomycin-induced DNA migration was higher in the exposed group (25%), whereas the repair of bleomycin-induced lesions was reduced.
p8900
aVWorkers had a 2.5-fold higher MN frequency, and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and nuclear buds (Nbuds) were increased 7-fold and 3-fold, respectively.
p8901
aVAlso, apoptosis and necrosis rates were higher, but only the latter parameter reached statistical significance.
p8902
aVV2O5 causes oxidation of DNA bases, affects DNA repair, and induces formation of MNs, NPBs, and Nbuds in blood cells, suggesting that the workers are at increased risk for cancer and other diseases that are related to DNA instability.
p8903
aVVanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is used for the production of metal alloys, for the manufacturing of lithium batteries and high-pressure lamps, and for the synthesis of chemicals [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2006].
p8904
aVIts annual production worldwide is in the range of 60,000 tons (IARC 2006; Woolery 1997).
p8905
aVOccupational exposure to the oxide occurs at production sites, during processing and refining of vanadium ores and sludges, during manufacturing of vanadium-containing products, in the course of combustion of vanadium-rich fuels, and by handling of catalysts in the chemical industry (Plunkett 1987).
p8906
aVEnvironmental exposure to the metal and its oxides occurs via inhalation in the vicinity of metallurgical plants or through consumption of contaminated foods (Barceloux 1999; IARC 2006).
p8907
aVAlthough foods contain low concentrations, nutrition is the major source of exposure for the general population (Barceloux 1999).
p8908
aVThe National Toxicology Program (NTP 2002) found an increase of lung adenomas and carcinomas in mice after inhalative exposure to V2O5; this was paralleled by an increased incidence of hyperplasia in lung tissue.
p8909
aVIn male rats, the number of tumors was elevated (nonsignificantly), whereas in females no increase was found (IARC 2006; NTP 2002; Ress et al.
p8910
aV2003).
p8911
aVThese findings led to a reevaluation of the metal oxide (IARC 2006) and to its classification as a group 2B (\u201cpossible human\u201d) carcinogen.
p8912
aVOne of the problems encountered in the risk assessment of V2O5 is the lack of human data.
p8913
aVAccording to IARC (2006), inhalative exposure to V2O5 in vanadium plants exists worldwide, and several hundred workers may be affected; furthermore, workers of other industries may also be exposed.
p8914
aVThe occupational exposure limit in Austria for V2O5 in air is 0.05 mg/m3 (Bundesminister für Wirtschaft und Arbeit 2003).
p8915
aVThe Senate Commission of the German Research Foundation [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)] decided to suspend the maximum allowed concentration of V2O5 in workplace air because of its suspected carcinogenicity (DFG 2006).
p8916
aVIn the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists established an occupational exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 air (Occupational Safety and Health Administration 2006).
p8917
aVMeasurements of air concentrations in vanadium factories yielded values in the range of 0.02\u20135 mg/m3 (IARC 2006).
p8918
aVResults of in vitro and animal studies indicate that the oxide causes formation of reactive oxygen species (Ingram et al.
p8919
aV2003, 2007; Wang et al.
p8920
aV2003; Zhang et al.
p8921
aV2001) and aneugenic effects (Migliore et al.
p8922
aV1993; Ramirez et al.
p8923
aV1997; Zhong et al.
p8924
aV1994) and interferes with DNA synthesis and repair (IARC 2006).
p8925
aVBecause DNA damage and aneugenic processes are known to play a role in the onset of human cancer (Duesberg et al.
p8926
aV2005; Pitot 1986), evidence of genetic damage in exposed humans would support the assumption of increased cancer risks.
p8927
aVAt present, only one study on the influence of occupational exposure to V2O5 on DNA stability has been published; in that study, Ivancsits et al.
p8928
aV(2002) investigated DNA migration in leukocytes using the standard single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay.
p8929
aVThe authors observed no indication of damage and found no elevation in the frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) or the concentration of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine in leukocytes.
p8930
aVLener et al.
p8931
aV(1998) found no SCEs or chromosomal aberrations in blood cells of children living in the vicinity of a vanadium production site.
p8932
aVOur goal in the present study was to comprehensively evaluate the impact of inhalative V2O5 exposure on genetic stability.
p8933
aVWe monitored DNA migration in leukocytes of workers and matched controls with the standard SCGE assay, and we monitored oxidized bases using lesion-specific enzymes (Collins et al.
p8934
aV1993).
p8935
aVFurthermore, we measured the sensitivity toward bleomycin (BLEO) and the repair of lesions induced by this cytostatic agent (Rajaee-Behbahani et al.
p8936
aV2001; Schmezer et al.
p8937
aV2001; Wei et al.
p8938
aV2005).
p8939
aVBLEO sensitivity was initially monitored in chromosomal aberration assays (Hsu et al.
p8940
aV1989; Szekely et al.
p8941
aV2003) and later in SCGE experiments (Schmezer et al.
p8942
aV2001).
p8943
aVAdditionally, we conducted cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN Cyt) assays with lymphocytes.
p8944
aVThis test is widely used for the detection of DNA damage in humans (Fenech 2007).
p8945
aVMicronuclei (MNs), which are formed as a consequence of chromosome breakage and/or aneuploidy (Fenech and Morley 1985), correlate with the incidence of cancer in humans (Bonassi et al.
p8946
aV2007).
p8947
aVAlso, we evaluated the frequencies of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and nuclear buds (Nbuds) in lymphocytes.
p8948
aVNPBs are assumed to occur when centromeres of dicentric chromosomes are pulled to the opposite poles of the cell at anaphase and provide a measure of chromosome rearrangements (Fenech 2006).
p8949
aVTherefore, NPBs give direct evidence of genome damage resulting from misrepaired DNA breaks, which cannot be detected when MNs are scored as the only end point.
p8950
aVNbuds form as a consequence of gene amplification (Fenech 2006).
p8951
aVAmplified DNA is selectively localized at specific sites of the nucleus and eliminated through recombinogenic events during the S-phase of mitosis (Shimizu et al.

p8972
aVWe measured vitamin B12 and folate in plasma using commercial radioimmunoassays (IUL Instruments GmbH, Königswinter, Germany) (Majchrzak et al.

p8975
aV(2002) for leukocyte isolation: EDTA-anticoagulated blood was maintained in erythrocyte-lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM KHCO3, 0.005 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4) at 37°C for 5 min; centrifuged (200 ×g, 5 min at 4°C); washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4); and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh, Munich, Germany) without serum (Buschini et al.

p8977
aVWe used a modified version of the protocol for BLEO sensitivity and DNA repair measurements (Schmezer et al.

p8979
aVLeukocytes were treated with 10 \u03bcg/mL BLEO sulfate (Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C for 30 min.
p8980
aVTo terminate the treatment, cells were washed twice in PBS (pH 7.4).
p8981
aVTo measure DNA repair capacity, we incubated a second batch of BLEO-treated cells for 15 min (37°C) before lysis and electrophoresis.

p8985
aV(2000).
p8986
aVBriefly, cell pellets were mixed with 60 \u03bcL 0.5% low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, Scotland), transferred to precoated (1.5% normal-melting-point agarose) glass slides, and sealed with a coverslip.
p8987
aVThe slides were placed on ice for 5 min to allow solidification of the agarose.
p8988
aVAfter removing the coverslip, we immersed the slides in lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, pH 10.0) and kept them at 4°C for \u2265 1 hr.

p8992
aVElectrophoresis was performed at 25 V and 300 mA for 20 min; then the slides were covered with neutralization buffer (0.4 M Trizma base, pH 7.5, 4°C) for 2 ×8 min and air dried.

p8994
aVWe used an automated analysis system (Helma and Uhl 2000) to acquire images, compute the integrated intensity profile for each cell, estimate the comet cell components, and evaluate derived parameters.
p8995
aVFor each experimental end point we analyzed three cultures, and we measured 50 randomly captured cells from each slide.

aVAfter lysis of the cells, the slides were washed in enzyme buffer (0.1 M KCl, 40 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM Na2EDTA, 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 4°C, pH 8) for 2 ×8 min.
p9001
aVSubsequently, agarose-embedded cells were covered with 50 \u03bcL enzyme buffer or with enzyme solutions (1.0 \u03bcg/mL).

aVFor each participant, we prepared lymphocyte cultures in duplicate.
p9013
aVEach culture contained 106 cells in 750 \u03bcL RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2.0 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 30 \u03bcg/mL phytohemagglutinin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
p9014
aVCultures were incubated in round-bottom tubes (Becton Dickinson) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
p9015
aVForty-four hours after mitogen stimulation, we added cytochalasin B (final concentration, 4.0 \u03bcg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to block cell division.
p9016
aVThe total incubation time of the cultures was 72 hr.
p9017
aVSubsequently, the cells were harvested and used to prepare slides, which were air dried, fixed, and stained with Diff Quick (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL, USA).
p9018
aVFrom each participant, we scored 2,000 binucleated cells using a light optical microscope (Microphot-FXA; Nikon) (Fenech et al.

aVWe performed statistical analyses using Statistica 5.0 software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).
p9021
aVThe results are presented as medians and 25th\u201375th percentiles.
p9022
aVAll p-values were two-tailed, and we considered differences to be significant at p \u2264 0.05.
p9023
aVWe used the Mann-Whitney U-test for comparisons between exposed subjects and controls.
p9024
aVWe used Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients to test univariate relationships between different variables.
p9025
aVThe characteristics of participants are summarized in Table 1.
p9026
aVAge and body mass index did not differ between the groups.
p9027
aVAll individuals were males and nonvegetarians.
p9028
aVThe control group included 11 smokers and the exposed group included 12.
p9029
aVThe concentrations of folate were similar in both groups, whereas levels of vitamins B6 and B12 were higher (8.1% and 31%, respectively) in the exposed group, possibly due to intake of supplements.
p9030
aVVanadium levels were 7-fold higher in the plasma of the exposed group.
p9031
aVTable 2 summarizes the results of the SCGE experiments.
p9032
aVWe found no difference of DNA migration between exposed individuals and control subjects when the assay was carried out under standard conditions (which reflect formation of single- and double-strand breaks), but we observed increased tail lengths and tail moments in all other end points in the workers.
p9033
aVFormation of oxidized purines (detected with FPG) was elevated by 7%, and the formation of pyrimidines (by ENDO III treatment) was enhanced by 33%.
p9034
aVFurthermore, the sensitivity of the cells toward BLEO-induced DNA damage was higher (25%) in the exposed individuals.
p9035
aVWhen we monitored DNA migration after a repair phase (15 min incubation after BLEO treatment), we observed a decrease of tail lengths (50%) and tail moments (57%) in the controls, whereas in the workers we observed no reduction of tail lengths and a less pronounced decrease of tail moments (30%).
p9036
aVData on the frequencies of MNs, NPBs, Nbuds, apoptosis, and necrosis rates, as well as the division indices [nuclear divison index (NDI) and nuclear divison cyto-toxicity index (NDCI)] are summarized in Table 3.
p9037
aVThe number of MNs was 2.5-fold higher in the workers, and the numbers of NPBs and Nbuds were substantially increased (7-fold and 3-fold, respectively) .
p9038
aVTo find out whether V2O5 exposure and smoking cause synergistic effects,
p9039
aVwe compared the frequencies of MNs and Nbuds in exposed smokers and nonsmokers to those in the corresponding controls.
p9040
aVIn nonexposed individuals, the levels (means ± SD) of MNs, Nbuds, and NPBs were similar in smokers and nonsmokers respectively (MNs, 1.77 ± 1.62 and 1.50 ± 1.86; Nbuds, 0.33 ± 0.39 and 0.36 ± 0.32; NPBs, 0.46 ± 0.81 and 0.45 ± 0.61).
p9041
aVIn workers, the MN rates were lower in smokers (4.17 ± 2.95 and 8.08 ± 4.54), whereas the frequencies of NPBs and Nbuds were more or less identical (NPBs, 6.83 ± 3.04 and 7.33 ± 2.50; Nbuds, 3.58 ± 2.76 and 3.30 ± 1.41).
p9042
aVThe frequencies of necrotic and apoptotic cells were elevated in the workers by 55% and 50%, respectively; for the latter parameter the difference was not significant.
p9043
aVThe last two rows of Table 3 show the nuclear division indices.
p9044
aVThe division rates were similar in both groups, regardless of whether we considered the number of viable cells only (NDI) or also dead cells (NDCI).
p9045
aVThese results indicate that metal exposure has no significant impact on the proliferative capacity of viable or total lymphocytes, respectively.
p9046
aVIn this article we present the results of the first comprehensive study on the impact of occupational exposure to airborne V2O5 on DNA stability.
p9047
aVFor seven of eight end points, we found significant differences between exposed workers and controls.
p9048
aVThe most important observation is the 2.5-fold higher frequency of MNs in lymphocytes of the exposed individuals (Table 3),
p9049
aVbecause a prospective study showed that MNs in peripheral blood lymphocytes are a valid biomarker for predicting an increased cancer risk in humans (Bonassi et al.
p9050
aV2007).
p9051
aVFurthermore, a smaller study showed strong predictability of the MN biomarker in lymphocytes for cardiovascular disease risk (Murgia et al.
p9052
aV2007).
p9053
aVBecause the levels of folate and vitamins B6 and B12 were equal or higher in the workers (Table 1), we can exclude that the increased MN levels in this group are due to deficiencies of these micronutrients.
p9054
aVV2O5 and other vanadium compounds induce MNs in bone marrow cells of rodents (Leopardi et al.
p9055
aV2005; Sun 1996).
p9056
aVFurthermore, DNA-damaging properties of vanadium compounds have also been found in human and animal cells in vitro (Ivancsits et al.
p9057
aV2002; Kleinsasser et al.
p9058
aV2003; Migliore et al.

aV1997; Rojas et al.
p9061
aV1996; Roldan and Altamirano 1990; Zhong et al.
p9062
aV1994).
p9063
aVIn the present study, we observed an increase of other end points of chromosomal stability (NPBs and Nbuds) in the workers.
p9064
aVThe induction of NPBs and Nbuds was even more pronounced than the increase in MN levels (Table 3),
p9065
aVand it is notable that a recent case\u2013control study on smokers showed that elevated NPB and Nbud frequencies are more strongly associated with lung cancer risk than are MN rates (El-Zein et al.
p9066
aV2006).
p9067
aVWe found no synergistic effect between smoking and V2O5 exposure in the present study.
p9068
aVBonassi et al.
p9069
aV(2003) conducted a meta-analysis concerning the impact of smoking on MN frequencies among subjects in occupational and environmental surveys.
p9070
aVThey concluded that only nonexposed heavy smokers exhibit a significant increase of MNs, whereas the MN frequency was not influenced by smoking among individuals exposed to genotoxic agents.
p9071
aVIn the latter group, even slightly reduced MN levels were found in smokers compared with nonsmokers (Bonassi et al.
p9072
aV2003).
p9073
aVThe only marker that was not elevated in the workers in the present study was DNA migration monitored in SCGE experiments under standard conditions, which reflect endogenous DNA damage such as single- and double-strand breaks and apurinic sites (Tice et al.
p9074
aV2000).
p9075
aVThis observation is in agreement with results of an earlier investigation (Ivancsits et al.
p9076
aV2002).
p9077
aVIn vitro studies have shown that the metal oxide induces DNA migration in blood cells under standard conditions, but the doses required to cause effects were substantially higher than the plasma concentrations in the workers in the present study (Ivancsits et al.
p9078
aV2002; Kleinsasser et al.
p9079
aV2003; Rojas et al.
p9080
aV1996).
p9081
aVFurthermore, results obtained in SCGE experiments with rodents indicate that vanadium compounds cause DNA migration in inner organs (Altamirano-Lozano et al.
p9082
aV1996, 1999; Leopardi et al.
p9083
aV2005; Villani et al.
p9084
aV2007).
p9085
aVIt is notable that the basal levels for tail lengths are quite low in the present study.
p9086
aVOur values are in a range similar to those found in other laboratories (Grossi et al.
p9087
aV2008; Undeger and Basaran 2005; Yoshida et al.
p9088
aV2006; Zhang et al.
p9089
aV2008) and also within the historical range of our laboratory (Bichler et al.
p9090
aV2007; Hoelzl et al.
p9091
aV2008; Steinkellner et al.
p9092
aV2005).
p9093
aVBecause we monitored the cell viability before electrophoresis, we can exclude that cell damage accounts for the low values.
p9094
aVFurthermore, the results obtained with tail moment in the present study are essentially identical to those from tail length measurements.
p9095
aVEndogenous formation of oxidized DNA bases (shown by treatment with the repair endonucleases FPG and ENDO III) is higher in the exposed group.
p9096
aVEarlier investigations found that vanadium-treated cells generate hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals (Huang et al.
p9097
aV2000; Shi and Dalal 1992; Ye et al.
p9098
aV1999; Zhang et al.
p9099
aV2001).
p9100
aVThese vanadium-induced radicals were shown to cause damage to macromolecules and lipid peroxidation (Donaldson et al.
p9101
aV1985),
p9102
aVand it is conceivable that they account for the oxidative damage that we observed in the present study.
p9103
aVIt is noteworthy that a number of human studies found increased sensitivity toward DNA damage by BLEO in individuals who are at increased risk for different types of cancer (Schmezer et al.
p9104
aV2001).
p9105
aVIn the present study, we found a strong difference between workers and controls after BLEO treatment and a 15-min repair phase (Table 2).
p9106
aVAlthough the tail lengths decreased by 50% in the controls, we saw no reduction in workers after the repair phase, and the tail moments were decreased to a higher extent in the controls.
p9107
aVThis indicates that the metal oxide interacts detrimentally with DNA repair processes.
p9108
aVIvancsits et al.
p9109
aV(2002) found severe inhibition of BLEO-induced repair by V2O5 in SCGE experiments with lymphocytes in vitro, whereas the repair of ultraviolet C\u2013induced lesions was less affected.
p9110
aVThese findings can be taken as an indication that V2O5 inhibits pathways that are required for the repair of BLEO-induced lesions (homologous recombination repair, nonhomologous end joining, and base excision repair) (Schlade-Bartusiak et al.
p9111
aV2002; Schmezer et al.
p9112
aV2001; Wei et al.
p9113
aV2005) and, to a lesser extent, nucleotide excision repair, which is required to repair ultraviolet C\u2013induced lesions (Wei et al.
p9114
aV2005).
p9115
aVAs shown in Table 3, we found that the frequencies of necrotic cells were higher in the workers.
p9116
aVAlso, programmed cell death (apoptosis) was increased, but this effect did not reach significance.
p9117
aVInduction of apoptosis by vanadium compounds has also been observed in earlier in vitro studies (Au et al.
p9118
aV2006; Huang et al.
p9119
aV2000; Lampronti et al.
p9120
aV2005; Ray et al.
p9121
aV2006; Wang et al.
p9122
aV2003; Ye et al.
p9123
aV1999), and it has been postulated that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by reactive oxygen species and/or by an oxidant-independent pathway may play a role (Chien et al.
p9124
aV2006; Choi et al.
p9125
aV2003; Huang et al.
p9126
aV2000; Luo et al.
p9127
aV2003).
p9128
aVStatistical analyses of the different end points showed no correlations between formation of oxidized purines and pyrimidines and MN induction (p = 0.3992 and 0.4679, respectively), which indicates that different mechanisms are involved.
p9129
aVAlthough oxidative damage of DNA bases caused by V2O5 is probably due to release of reactive oxygen species, the formation of MNs may be due to its aneugenic properties,
p9130
aVwhich have been found in in vitro studies (Galli et al.
p9131
aV1991; Roldan and Altamirano 1990; Zhong et al.
p9132
aV1994) and are apparently caused by disturbances of microtubule assembly (Ramirez et al.
p9133
aV1997).
p9134
aVWe also failed to find correlations between vanadium plasma levels and formation of oxidized purines (p = 0.2340), pyrimidines (p = 0.2895), and MN frequencies (p = 0.1571).
p9135
aVEarlier studies with workers exposed to metals other than vanadium indicate that polymorphisms in repair genes have a strong impact on MN formation (Iarmarcovai et al.
p9136
aV2006; Mateuca et al.
p9137
aV2005, 2008), and
p9138
aVit is conceivable that they also play a role in the case of the effects caused by V2O5.
p9139
aVOverall, our results show that inhalative exposure to V2O5 increases the levels of oxidized bases and of MN, NPB, and Nbud frequencies in blood cells and affects their DNA repair capacity.
p9140
aVIt is notable that vanadium levels similar to or even higher than those found in our study have been detected in workers of other vanadium industries and in welders (Altamirano-Lozano et al.
p9141
aV1999; Huang et al.
p9142
aV2000; Ivancsits et al.
p9143
aV2002; Shi and Dalal 1992; Villani et al.
p9144
aV2007).
p9145
aVBecause the aforementioned parameters are causally related to diseases including cancer, our findings strongly suggest that more protective measures and periodical monitoring of the workers are required.
p9146
aVFurthermore, the current exposure levels should be reduced to avoid health risks due to vanadium-induced DNA instability.
p9147
aVInhalation of high levels of airborne inorganic arsenic is a recognized cause of respiratory cancer.
p9148
aVAlthough multiple epidemiologic studies have demonstrated this association, there have been few analyses of the mathematical relationship between cumulative arsenic exposure and risk of respiratory cancer, and no assessment as to whether and how arsenic concentration may modify this association.
p9149
aVThe objective is an evaluation of the shape of the relationship between respiratory cancer mortality and cumulative inhaled arsenic exposure among copper smelter workers, and the modification of that relationship by arsenic concentration.
p9150
aVWe used Poisson regression methods to analyze data from a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers under a linear-exponential model for the excess relative risk.
p9151
aVWithin categories of arsenic concentration, the association between respiratory cancer and cumulative arsenic exposure was consistent with linearity.
p9152
aVThe slope of the linear relationship with cumulative exposure increased with increasing arsenic concentration category.
p9153
aVOur results suggested a direct concentration effect from inhaled inorganic arsenic, whereby the excess relative risk for a fixed cumulative exposure was greater when delivered at a higher concentration and shorter duration than when delivered at a lower concentration and longer duration.
p9154
aVThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (1980, 1987) identifies inhalation of inorganic arsenic as a cause of lung cancer in humans.
p9155
aVThe evidence has come primarily from epidemiologic studies of miners and smelter workers who inhaled high levels of inorganic arsenic in airborne dust.
p9156
aVAlthough increased risk of lung cancer from inhaled arsenic appears related to direct effects on the respiratory tract, there may be a systemic effect as well, because ingestion of high amounts of inorganic arsenic in drinking water has been associated with lung cancer mortality at levels comparable with occupational risks from inhaled arsenic (Bates et al.
p9157
aV1992; Lubin et al.
p9158
aV2000).
p9159
aVInformation on the mathematical relationship between cumulative inhaled arsenic exposure and respiratory cancer mortality is limited.
p9160
aVAlthough a comparative evaluation of several occupational cohorts, mostly smelter workers, suggested a concave relationship between respiratory cancer mortality and cumulative arsenic exposure (Hertz-Picciotto and Smith 1993), a subsequent update of one large study revealed that its apparent nonlinearity was an artifact of exposure assessment and that relative risk (RR) trends with cumulative arsenic exposure were consistent with a linear relationship (Lubin et al.
p9161
aV2000).
p9162
aVPrevious analyses have focused on cumulative arsenic exposure and the shape of the exposure\u2013response relationship, without considering the possible influence of arsenic concentration.
p9163
aVIn the present analysis, we applied a novel methodology used previously in a study of smoking-related lung cancer (Lubin and Caporaso 2006) to model cumulative arsenic exposure and arsenic concentration.
p9164
aVIn particular, we examined the consequences of exposure \u201cdelivery,\u201d that is, whether the RR of respiratory cancer at a fixed cumulative exposure delivered at higher arsenic concentration for shorter duration was greater than, equal to, or less than the RR from an equal cumulative exposure delivered at lower concentration for longer duration.
p9165
aVWe refer to these patterns as direct (increasing), constant (no variation), or inverse (decreasing) \u201cexposure rate\u201d effects.
p9166
aVStandard analyses of joint RRs by duration of arsenic exposure and arsenic concentration with nonexposed individuals as the referent group are problematic for characterizing the effects of arsenic concentration, because cumulative exposure varies.
p9167
aVFor illustration, consider duration of cigarette smoking, smoking intensity (cigarettes smoked per day), and total pack-years (years of smoking times cigarettes per day divided by 20).
p9168
aVIn a standard log-linear RR regression model that includes duration of smoking and cigarettes per day, the intensity parameter represents the ln(RR) per cigarette per day at a fixed duration.
p9169
aVInterpretation of the duration parameter is similar but at a fixed intensity.
p9170
aVA comparison of RRs at two different intensities reflects not only different intensities, but also different total pack-years.
p9171
aVFor example, at 30 years\u2019 duration, RRs at 20 and 30 cigarettes per day reflect different intensities and different total pack-years\u2014namely, 30 and 45 pack-years, respectively.
p9172
aVThus, RR patterns with duration and intensity cannot be viewed as \u201cindependent\u201d because of the intrinsic confounding of pack-years.
p9173
aVIn contrast, in a model that includes pack-years and cigarettes per day, the parameter for cigarettes per day represents the comparison of risk for exposure delivered at lower intensity for longer duration with risk for an equal total exposure delivered at higher intensity for shorter duration (Lubin and Caporaso 2006).
p9174
aVWe use this framework to analyze inhalation of airborne inorganic arsenic in a cohort mortality study of smelter workers conducted in Montana (Lee and Fraumeni 1969; Lee-Feldstein 1983; Lubin et al.
p9175
aV1981, 2000).
p9176
aVOur goal of modeling the cumulative airborne arsenic exposure and arsenic concentration is to estimate a descriptive function that defines the modifying effect of concentration on the association between cumulative exposure and respiratory cancer.
p9177
aVThis effect modification is conceptually similar to the \u201cdose rate effective factor\u201d used in radiation epidemiology that describes for a specific type of radiation the effects on disease risk of total radiation dose delivered at lower (protracted or highly fractionated) dose rates compared with the effects at higher (or acute) dose rates (National Research Council 2006).
p9178
aVThe cohort study enrolled workers employed at a Montana copper smelter for \u22651 year before 1957, with follow-up starting 1 year after initial employment or 1 January 1938, whichever was later (Lee and Fraumeni 1969).
p9179
aVThe present analysis included 8,014 workers followed through 1989 (Lubin et al.
p9180
aV2000).
p9181
aVWe determined vital status from the National Death Index (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm) and other sources, with causes of death recorded from death certificates.
p9182
aVA total of 4,930 (62%) workers were deceased.
p9183
aVFollowing previous analyses of this cohort, we consider respiratory cancer mortality as the primary outcome.
p9184
aVIn the 1960s, investigators ranked each work site from 1 to 10 for its potential arsenic exposure and classified each site as \u201cheavy\u201d (ranks 8\u201310), \u201cmedium\u201d (ranks 4\u20137), or \u201clight\u201d (ranks 1\u20133) arsenic exposure areas (Lee and Fraumeni 1969).
p9185
aVWe classified unspecified or unknown work areas as light exposure areas.
p9186
aVWe subsequently updated employment information through September 1977 (Lee-Feldstein 1986).
p9187
aVUsing 702 measurements of airborne arsenic from 1943 through 1958 and estimates of workers\u2019 exposure times, investigators computed time-weighted average arsenic concentrations for light, medium, and heavy arsenic-exposed areas as 0.29, 0.58, and 11.3 mg/m3, respectively (Morris 1978).
p9188
aVFor each year of follow-up, we computed a cumulative exposure index in mg/m3-year, denoted d, as the product of years worked in light (L), medium (M), and heavy (H) exposure areas and the corresponding concentration\u2014that is, d = 0.29 × L + 0.58 × M + 1.13 × H\u2014where we down-weighted heavy exposure areas by a factor of 0.1 to reflect use of air filtration masks.
p9189
aVThis a priori choice of weight was similar to an empirically derived, risk-based estimate of weight (Lubin et al.
p9190
aV1981).
p9191
aVMany workers had recorded ages at last employment of &lt; 40 and 50 years.
p9192
aVBecause there was no information on exposures after the workers left the smelter, we repeated analyses using person-years and respiratory cancer deaths in current workers, recent former (&lt; 5 years) workers, and workers with last employment at \u2265 50 years of age to minimize effects of unmeasured exposures.
p9193
aVThe restricted subset included 261 respiratory cancer cases and 144,851 person-years.
p9194
aVThe number of respiratory cancer cases differed from a previous report (n = 252) (Lubin et al.
p9195
aV2000) because of a modified definition of the restrictions.
p9196
aVWe assumed survival time follows a piecewise exponential distribution and applied Poisson regression methods.
p9197
aVWe summarized deaths from respiratory cancer and person-years of follow-up in a multiway contingency table defined by attained age (nine levels: &lt; 45, 45\u201349, .

p9201
aVFor each cell of the cross-classification, we computed person-year\u2013weighted means for the cross-classification variables.
p9202
aVBecause all workers were exposed to arsenic, we used age-specific and calendar-year-specific U.S. mortality rates for respiratory cancer in white males as a nonexposed referent population (Breslow and Day 1987).
p9203
aVWe defined indicator variables c i , i = 1, .

aV, I, for I concentration categories where c i = 1 for intensities within category i and zero otherwise, and modeled disease rate r(x,d,c) as
p9205
aVwhere d is cumulative arsenic exposure and c is arsenic concentration.
p9206
aVThe vectors of variables x and parameters \u03b1, where T denotes vector transpose, describe disease rates in non-exposed workers.
p9207
aVWithin concentration category i, RRs are linear in d; that is, RR(d,c) = 1 + \u03b3 i d, where \u03b3 i is the slope of the linear exposure\u2013response, or ERR/mg/m3-year (ERR, excess relative risk).
p9208
aVWe used Wald-type confidence intervals (CIs) for \u03b3 i after reparameterizing \u03b3 i as exp(\u03b3 i *) to avoid range restrictions.
p9209
aVFactoring out \u03b31, we rewrote RR(d,c) as
p9210
aVwhich suggested the following model for continuous concentration:
p9211
aVwhere \u03b2 defined ERR/mg/m3-year at g(c) = 1.
p9212
aVThe g(.)
p9213
aVfunction represents the modifying effects of arsenic concentration on the exposure\u2013response relationship.
p9214
aVPreliminary analysis suggested using the power form g(c) = exp{\u03c6 ln(c)}, where \u03c6 &gt; 0, \u03c6 = 0, or \u03c6 &lt; denotes a direct (increasing), constant (no variation), or inverse (decreasing) concentration effect, respectively.
p9215
aVModel fit did not improve with the addition of c or ln(c)2.
p9216
aVWe extended model 1 to
p9217
aVto evaluate departure from linearity, where \u03b4 i reflects concavity (\u03b4 i &lt; 0) or convexity (\u03b4 i &gt; 0) of the ERRs with cumulative exposure for the ith concentration category.
p9218
aVThe null hypothesis \u03b4 i = specified no departure from linearity.
p9219
aVWe applied a similar extension to model 2.
p9220
aVBecause all workers were exposed, we included the natural logarithm of the age- and year-specific respiratory cancer rates of U.S. males as a fixed offset variable (x) to represent rates in nonexposed workers.
p9221
aVThe model thus represented a regression equation for standardized mortality ratios (SMR) (Breslow and Day 1987).
p9222
aVAlthough model 2 reflected relative SMRs, we refer to quantities as RRs.
p9223
aVFor analyses, we used the Epicure suite of programs (Preston et al.
p9224
aV2004).
p9225
aVThe person-year\u2013weighted mean cumulative arsenic exposure was 3.7 mg/m3-years, with a crude respiratory cancer mortality rate of 1.73 per 1,000 person-years, based on 446 total respiratory cancer deaths (Table 1).
p9226
aVThe SMR for respiratory cancer was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.4\u20131.7).
p9227
aVIn the restricted data, the mean cumulative arsenic exposure was 5.4 mg/m3-years, the crude respiratory mortality rate per 1,000 person-years was 1.80, and the SMR was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.7\u20132.1).
p9228
aVSMRs increased with cumulative arsenic exposure and with arsenic concentration (Table 2).
p9229
aVThe SMR in the lowest concentration category was significantly elevated, suggesting a difference between respiratory cancer mortality rates for U.S. males and a hypothetical group of nonexposed workers.
p9230
aVWe fitted model 1 with continuous cumulative arsenic exposure and six categories of arsenic concentration and estimated respiratory cancer rates in a hypothetical group of nonexposed workers relative to the standard population.
p9231
aVAfter adjustment for arsenic exposure, SMRs for nonexposed workers were 3.10 (95% CI, 2.3\u20134.2), 2.22 (95% CI, 1.6\u20133.1), and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.1\u20132.0) for calendar periods &lt; 1960, 1960\u201369, and \u22651970, respectively, and the effect of U.S. birth relative to foreign birth was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.5\u20130.9).
p9232
aVSMRs did not vary significantly with attained age.
p9233
aVWe included offset parameters fixed at the logarithms of these \u201cnonexposed\u201d SMRs to adjust for differences between \u201cnonexposed\u201d workers and the standard population.
p9234
aVAfter adjustment, SMRs increased with cumulative arsenic exposure and with arsenic concentration, but at a lesser rate of increase (Table 2).
p9235
aVWithin each arsenic concentration category, RRs increased with cumulative arsenic exposure (Figure 1).
p9236
aVTwo characteristics in the figure are noteworthy.
p9237
aVFirst, RRs by cumulative arsenic exposure were consistent with linearity within each concentration category.
p9238
aVTests of the null hypothesis of no departure from linearity were not rejected.
p9239
aVSecond, estimates of the slope parameters \u03b3 i (i.e., the ERR/mg/m3-year) varied significantly (p-value for homogeneity of slopes, p = 0.02) and generally increased, suggesting a greater exposure\u2013response relationship with increasing arsenic concentration.
p9240
aVThe change in the ERR/mg/m3-year estimate (i.e., the slope) represents the effect modification by arsenic concentration of the relationship between respiratory cancer and cumulative arsenic exposure.
p9241
aVFigure 2 plots the slope estimate by mean arsenic concentration for six concentration categories (square symbols, with CIs omitted for clarity), the fitted model 2 using continuous data (solid line), its pointwise 95% CI (dashed lines), and the model for no variation with concentration (model 2 with \u03c6 = 0; dotted line).
p9242
aVThe ERR/mg/m3-year estimate (\u03b2) was \u03b2 = 0.115 (95% CI 0.07\u20130.19) (Table 3), and varied significantly with arsenic concentration (p &lt; 0.01).
p9243
aVAfter adjusting for cumulative arsenic exposure, the ERR/mg/m3-year increased with increasing concentration (estimate of \u03c6 was 1.123 (95% CI, 0.41\u20131.84).
p9244
aVResults in the restricted data were similar.
p9245
aVUsing model 2, we evaluated time since last arsenic exposure as a modifier of the arsenic exposure\u2013response relationship.
p9246
aVWe focus on the restricted data, although we show results for all data for completeness.
p9247
aVAlthough variations were not statistically significant, the cumulative arsenic exposure effect (\u03b2) decreased with time since last arsenic exposure by factors of 1.0, 0.8, and 0.2 for &lt; 5, 5\u201314, and \u226515 years since last exposure, respectively (Table 3; change in deviance = 2.6 and p = 0.27 comparing models B0-R and T1-R; or change in deviance = 1.2 and p = 0.55 comparing models T2-R and T3-R).
p9248
aVThe arsenic concentration effect (\u03c6) also varied with time since last exposure, but changes in deviance were smaller (Table 3; change in deviance = 1.9 and p = 0.39 comparing models B0-R and T2-R, or change in deviance = 0.5 and p = 0.78 comparing T1-R and T3-R).
p9249
aVIn the restricted data, there was a suggestion of declining arsenic effects with attained age, but no preference for effect modification of age with either cumulative arsenic exposure or arsenic concentration.
p9250
aVIn our study of copper smelter workers, RRs for respiratory cancer increased linearly with cumulative arsenic exposure within categories of arsenic concentration.
p9251
aVIn addition, we found a direct concentration effect, whereby the slope of the linear exposure\u2013response relationship increased with arsenic concentration.
p9252
aVThis pattern implied that for equal cumulative arsenic exposure, the RR of respiratory cancer mortality was greater for cumulative arsenic exposure delivered at higher concentration for shorter duration compared with cumulative exposure delivered at lower concentration for longer duration.
p9253
aVThe increase in the exposure\u2013response relationship within each arsenic concentration category occurred for the full range of concentrations experienced by smelter workers, suggesting that the direct concentration effect was not rate limited within this range.
p9254
aVOne explanation for the impact of arsenic concentration on the association between cumulative arsenic exposure and respiratory cancer may be found in the concentration-dependent ability of cells to methylate and detoxify arsenic.
p9255
aVAlthough human populations differ, most humans exposed to arsenic excrete 10\u201330% inorganic arsenic, 10\u201320% monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V) and MMA(III)], and 60\u201380% dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V) and DMA(III)].
p9256
aVThe pentavalent metabolites MMA(V) and DMA(V) are generally considered less toxic than inorganic arsenite or arsenate.
p9257
aVTrivalent methylated arsenic metabolites are more genotoxic than inorganic arsenite both in vitro and in vivo (Styblo et al.
p9258
aV2002).
p9259
aVAlthough MMA(III) and DMA(III) can be measured in urine, epidemiologic studies to date have not measured trivalent arsenicals because of the preservation techniques required (Aposhian et al.
p9260
aV2000; Le et al.
p9261
aV2000; Mandal et al.
p9262
aV2001; Valenzuela et al.
p9263
aV2005).
p9264
aVEpidemiologic studies have used the percent MMA of total inorganic arsenic and the MMA:DMA ratio as surrogate markers of methylation efficiency of ingested arsenic, with increased levels of excreted percent MMA and MMA:DMA ratio in urine indicating reduced methylation efficiency.
p9265
aVStudies of arsenic in drinking water conducted in Taiwan, Argentina, Bangladesh, and certain areas of the United States have reported elevated risks of bladder and skin cancers associated with an increased percent MMA in urine, as well as a greater MMA:DMA ratio (Ahsan et al.
p9266
aV2007; Chen et al.
p9267
aV2003a, 2003b; Hsueh et al.
p9268
aV1997; Pu et al.
p9269
aV2007; Steinmaus et al.
p9270
aV2006; Yu et al.
p9271
aV2000).
p9272
aVThese findings are supported by toxicologic studies showing that methylated arsenicals, particularly MMA(III), have a greater affinity than the nonmethylated forms for protein binding to monothiol, dithiol, and trithiol sites, which can disrupt a number of processes, including gene transcription, glutathione synthesis, DNA methylation, DNA repair, cell division, generation of reactive oxygen species, and signal transduction pathways within cells (Cullen and Reimer 1989; Kitchin and Wallace 2008; Kumagai and Sumi 2007; Lin et al.
p9273
aV1999, 2001; Mass et al.
p9274
aV2001; Petrick et al.
p9275
aV2001; Styblo et al.
p9276
aV2000; Styblo and Thomas 1997).
p9277
aVIn addition, studies of urinary arsenic methylation patterns of healthy individuals exposed to arsenic in drinking water have shown increased percent MMA relative to total urinary arsenic (Hopenhayn-Rich et al.
p9278
aV1996b), whereas the percentage of inorganic arsenic and the MMA:DMA ratio decreased when the arsenic concentration in drinking water was reduced to lower levels (Hopenhayn-Rich et al.
p9279
aV1996a).
p9280
aVThese findings suggest that the mechanisms through which arsenic is methylated and excreted can become rate-limited at higher concentrations, perhaps through several steps including enzyme-catalyzed methylation of arsenic through S-adenosyl methionine, or glutathione synthesis (Waters et al.
p9281
aV2004).
p9282
aVThe toxicologic effects of arsenic described above are multifaceted.
p9283
aVHowever, toxicologic studies conducted to date support only the notion that concentration of exposure has a direct impact on the degree of toxicity and/or DNA damage acquired.
p9284
aVTotal cumulative arsenic exposure is a function of both concentration and duration of arsenic exposure.
p9285
aVOur findings suggest that rates of arsenic biotrans-formation and excretion are concentration dependent.
p9286
aVToxicologic studies designed to compare cellular and genetic toxicity at a given total cumulative dose delivered at different dose rates are needed to enhance understanding of the mechanistic implications of our results.
p9287
aVConsistent with our findings, two epidemiologic studies have suggested that the toxic effects from cumulative arsenic exposure in drinking water are greater among individuals exposed at higher, as opposed to lower, concentrations.
p9288
aVIn a case\u2013control study of arsenic-related skin lesions in a screened population in Bangladesh, about 70% of subjects consumed drinking water with arsenic concentrations &gt; 50 \u03bcg/L (Rahman et al.
p9289
aV2006).
p9290
aVFor similar levels of cumulative arsenic exposure, the odds ratios were higher for subjects with older ages at first exposure compared with those younger at first exposure.
p9291
aVBecause older age at first exposure would reflect shorter duration of exposure, the results suggested higher risks for cumulative exposures with shorter durations and correspondingly higher concentrations,
p9292
aVas we observed for lung cancer among smelter workers.
p9293
aVIn a case\u2013control study of bladder cancer in New Hampshire, odds ratios among smokers increased with higher concentrations of toenail arsenic, with risks being greater among individuals with shorter (&lt; 15 years) compared with longer residence in the current home (Karagas et al.
p9294
aV2004).
p9295
aVA threshold for the carcinogenic effects of arsenic in drinking water at about 150 \u03bcg/L, below which there is no risk from exposure, has been suggested (Lamm et al.
p9296
aV2006).
p9297
aVAlthough studies of noncancer outcomes, such as arsenical dermatoses, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, do not support a threshold (Ahsan et al.
p9298
aV2006; Engel et al.
p9299
aV1994; Rahman et al.
p9300
aV2006; Yu et al.
p9301
aV2006), studies of cancer outcomes after relatively low levels of exposure have been limited by low power and potential exposure misclassification (Cantor and Lubin 2007).
p9302
aVOur results may inform the exposure threshold issue.
p9303
aVIn areas of Taiwan with endemic blackfoot disease, Bates et al.
p9304
aV(1992) estimated that consuming drinking water with 470 \u03bcg/L arsenic resulted in a lifetime intake of 30,000 mg arsenic.
p9305
aVIngestion of drinking water with 150 \u03bcg/L arsenic therefore corresponds approximately to a lifetime intake of 9,600 mg arsenic.
p9306
aVMeasurement of urinary arsenic and its metabolites serves as a measure of absorption of inhaled arsenic through the respiratory tract, because arsenic excretion occurs mainly through the kidneys (World Health Organization 2001).
p9307
aVIn a study of smelter workers in Tacoma, Washington, investigators empirically derived the following relationship between inhaled and urinary arsenic levels: airborne arsenic in micrograms per cubic meter = 0.0064 (urine arsenic in micrograms per liter)1.924 (Enterline et al.
p9308
aV1987).
p9309
aVIn our data, mean airborne arsenic concentrations for the four categories in Figure 1 ranged from 0.29 to 0.65 mg/m3, and therefore correspond roughly to urinary arsenic levels from 263 to 400 \u03bcg/L.
p9310
aVAssuming 2 L urine per day, 250 working days per year, no other sources of arsenic and no accumulation of arsenic in the body (Bates et al.
p9311
aV1992), the mean durations of exposure, which ranged from 9.7 to 12.1 years for the four categories, correspond to mean total arsenic intakes of 1,315 (= 263 × 2 × 250 × 10 year/1,000), 1,420, 1,649, and 1,996 mg arsenic, respectively.
p9312
aVThus, cumulative arsenic exposure in the smelter workers corresponded to &lt; 20% of the lifetime arsenic intake at the postulated threshold.
p9313
aVOur finding of a linear relationship for the RR of respiratory cancer mortality across the full range of cumulative arsenic exposures within each category of arsenic concentration argues against a threshold at 150 \u03bcg/L.
p9314
aVIn summary, our cohort study of copper smelter workers revealed a linear relationship between cumulative arsenic exposure and respiratory cancer mortality within categories of arsenic concentration.
p9315
aVIn addition, we found a direct concentration effect on the exposure\u2013response relationship, indicating that for a fixed level of cumulative arsenic exposure, inhalation of higher concentrations of arsenic over shorter durations was more deleterious than inhalation of lower concentrations over longer durations.
p9316
aVHuman exposure to brevetoxins produced by the red tide organism, Karenia brevis, is an increasing public health concern.
p9317
aVUsing in vitro exposure of rat liver cells to brevetoxin B (PbTx-2), the primary toxin product of K. brevis, we previously showed that it formed C27,28-epoxy brevetoxin metabolites capable of covalently binding to nucleic acids, a common initiation step for carcinogenesis.
p9318
aVThis study was undertaken to evaluate nucleic acid adduction in lung following in vitro and in vivo brevetoxin exposures.
p9319
aVTo clarify reactions of brevetoxin epoxide with DNA, we analyzed reaction products of PbTx-6 (a C27,28 epoxide metabolite of brevetoxin B) with nucleosides.
p9320
aVWe also analyzed adducts from nucleic acid hydrolysates of isolated rat lung cells treated with PbTx-2 or PbTx-6 in vitro and lung tissue from rats after intratracheal exposure to PbTx-2 or PbTx-6 at 45 \u03bcg toxin/kg body weight.
p9321
aVOur results indicate that PbTx-2 forms DNA adducts with cytidine after treatment of isolated lung cells, and forms DNA adducts with adenosine and guanosine after intratracheal exposure.
p9322
aVThese results are consistent with metabolic activation of highly reactive brevetoxin intermediates that bind to nucleic acid.
p9323
aVThese findings provide a basis for monitoring exposure and assessing the hazard associated with depurination of brevetoxin\u2013nucleotide adducts in lung tissue.
p9324
aVKarenia brevis, formerly Gymnodinium breve, a brevetoxin-producing dinoflagellate, is recognized as the major harmful algae forming the red tide blooms in the Gulf of Mexico (Davis 1948).
p9325
aVTwo classes of brevetoxins were originally isolated from K. brevis by high pressure liquid chromatography (Risk et al.
p9326
aV1979).
p9327
aVStructural analysis of these fractions identified two backbone structures, containing either 11 (brevetoxin-B) or 10 (brevetoxin-A) fused cyclic ether rings (Lin et al.
p9328
aV1981; Shimizu et al.
p9329
aV1986).
p9330
aVEach backbone structure has similar functional groups and is subject to similar metabolic modifications (Wang et al.

p9332
aVBrevetoxins bind to voltage-gated sodium channels to alter gating transitions interfering with the sensitive movements that transition the channel\u2019s closed, open, and inactivated states (Catterall and Risk 1981).
p9333
aVThe initial actions of brevetoxins lead to nerve activation; within a few seconds of nerve activation, transient repetitive neuronal discharges are followed by action potential depression and eventually by a complete blockade of neuronal excitability (Huang et al.
p9334
aV1984).
p9335
aVThe direct consumption of brevetoxin-laden shellfish causes the food poisoning referred to as neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) in humans (McFarren et al.
p9336
aV1965).
p9337
aVNSP has become a rare phenomenon, even with the frequent occurrence of red tide events, in large part due to effective monitoring and management of shellfish harvest.
p9338
aVHowever, inhalation of airborne brevetoxins at beaches remains common, and the occupational and recreational hazards have been the subject of recent investigations (Backer et al.
p9339
aV2003, 2005).
p9340
aVExperimental exposure of brevetoxin aerosols was first demonstrated by Woodcock (1948), and in the last decade several studies have characterized the toxicokinetics and adverse effects of brevetoxins after intratracheal exposure of rats or sheep (Abraham et al.
p9341
aV2005; Benson et al.
p9342
aV1999).
p9343
aVDuring this time, various animal and tissue explant models have been used to discriminate the molecular actions of brevetoxins on voltage-gated sodium channels in lung smooth muscle, autonomic nerve, and central respiratory centers (Ramsdell 2008).
p9344
aVExposure to brevetoxin-containing aerosols has also been shown to cause severe allergic reactions in asthmatic patients (Fleming et al.
p9345
aV2007; Kirkpatrick et al.
p9346
aV2006), but to date the adverse effects of direct exposure to the respiratory tract have not been found to be severe in healthy subjects.
p9347
aVA second potentially adverse mode of brevetoxin action may be oxidative damage as result of brevetoxin metabolism.
p9348
aVPrevious research has shown that the brevetoxin B (PbTx-2) is widely metabolized after systemic administration to rats, after exposure to freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, and after treatment with cDNA-expressed rat cytochrome P-450 enzymes (Radwan and Ramsdell 2006; Radwan et al.

aVMetabolic reactions were observed on the A-ring, H-ring, and R-group of the terminal K-ring.
p9351
aVThey included hydrolysis (A-ring), epoxidation (H-ring), oxidation (R-group aldehyde), reduction (R-group aldehyde and \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carbon), and peptide conjugation (R-group \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde) (Figure 1).
p9352
aVThe epoxide metabolites are of interest because epoxides are highly reactive intermediates that react with nucleophilic sites to form covalent adducts with cellular macromolecules such as DNA and proteins (Koskinen and Plna 2000).
p9353
aVThe large variability of phase I or II enzymes among animal species and their target organs defines a key question concerning organ-specific toxicity.
p9354
aVWhether the actual target has the capacity to activate (or efficiently deactivate) chemicals is a key factor in susceptibility to toxin adduction.
p9355
aVLung is a target organ for the toxicity of most inhaled toxins.
p9356
aVOccupational, accidental, or prolonged pulmonary exposure to elevated concentrations of brevetoxins is now the primary route for toxicity in humans during red tide blooms.
p9357
aVYet the mechanism by which lung cells metabolize brevetoxin to reduce its potential toxicity is still unknown.
p9358
aVResults of several studies indicate that a variety of xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochromes [such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A and CYP3A families] in the human lung and in lung-derived cell lines contributes to the in situ activation of pulmonary toxins (Castell et al.
p9359
aV2005).
p9360
aVLung cells also express phase II enzymes such as epoxide hydrolase, UGT1A (glucuronyl transferase), and GST-P1 (glutathione S-transferase), which largely act as detoxifying enzymes.
p9361
aVAdduct formation is a key step in inducing genotoxicity as a result of exposure to chemicals and metabolites that damage nucleic acid.
p9362
aVThe present study aimed to investigate brevetoxin adduction with nucleic materials in the lungs of exposed rats and thus to provide insight into DNA adduction by brevetoxins following metabolic activation.
p9363
aVDetection of brevetoxin\u2013nucleic acid adduction has pharmacological and risk assessment importance and should provide a foundation for biological monitoring of human exposure to such genotoxic environmental agents.

aVBrevetoxin treatments were carried out at Charles River Laboratories Inc., (Horsham, PA, USA) using 12-week-old Charles River male rats [Crl:CD(SD)IGS BR VAF/Plus; 225\u2013250 g body weight].

p9397
aVCultured cells (~ 3.3 × 106/test) were thawed and resuspended in 200 \u03bcL phosphate buffer (0.1 M).
p9398
aVLung tissues were minced into smaller pieces in a Petri dish containing Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 20 mM EDTA, pH 7.8, on ice.
p9399
aVWe transferred 25-mg pieces to a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube and rinsed them at least three times in PBS.
p9400
aVCells or lung tissues were initially digested with protease K for 4 hr at 65°C.
p9401
aVThe mixture was loaded into the DNeasy spin column placed in a 2-mL collection tube.
p9402
aVUnbound substances were collected during washing process.
p9403
aVWe determined the purity of the eluted nucleic acid extract by the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm (A260) and A280 (the accepted purity ratios A260/A280 were ~ 1.85).
p9404
aVWe determined the concentration based on a solution containing 50 \u03bcg/mL of double-stranded DNA having an absorbency (optical density; OD) of 1.0 at a wavelength of 260.
p9405
aVExtracts were stored at \u221280°C until use.
p9406
aVExtracts were acid hydrolyzed in 0.1 N HCl at 75°C for 30 min (Hertzog et al.
p9407
aV1980).
p9408
aVWe then adjusted the pH to about 4.5 with 5 N NH4OH.
p9409
aVThe nucleic acid hydrolysates were redissolved in 10% methanol and loaded onto a previously conditioned SPE C-18 cartridge (500 mg; Varian).
p9410
aVThe cartridge was washed with 5 mL distilled water, and brevetoxin adducts were then eluted with 10 mL 85% methanol.
p9411
aVThe eluate containing brevetoxin nucleoside adducts was concentrated to dryness under nitrogen stream.
p9412
aVWe resuspended the dried adducts in 100 \u03bcL of 50% methanol for immediate RIA or liquid chromatography (LC)/MS analyses.
p9413
aVWe performed an RIA selective for toxins with the B-type backbone brevetoxin as described previously (Woofter et al.
p9414
aV2003).
p9415
aVTests were carried out in borosilicate glass tubes using antibodies raised in sheep immunized with PbTx-2\u2013fetuin conjugate (Garthwaite et al.
p9416
aV2001).
p9417
aVAssays were conducted in RIA buffer, a PBS containing 0.01% Emulphor-EL 620 with a final volume of 500 \u03bcL/test.
p9418
aVBriefly, 5 \u03bcL of adduct extract, or PbTx-3 (the PbTx-2 terminal alcohol reduction product) standard set (from 0.01 to 1,000 nM) was incubated with 20 \u03bcL anti-PbTx antiserum (1:4,000) in RIA buffer for 1 hr at 25°C.
p9419
aVThereafter, 0.4 nM of the 3H-PbTx-3 tracer was added, and the incubation proceeded for another hour.
p9420
aVFinally, we added 100 \u03bcL Sac-Cel (IDS Diagnostics, Fountain Hills, AZ, USA) to each of the assay tubes allowing the separation of the bound and unbound brevetoxin.
p9421
aVThe Sac-Cel mixture was filtered onto 25-mm diameter GF/B glass fiber filters (Whatman, Newton, MA, USA).
p9422
aVThe filters were immersed in 5 mL Scintiverse (Fisher, Suwannee, GA, USA) for 18 hr, and the radioactivity was counted on a Tri-Carb 3100TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience Company, Meriden, CT, USA).
p9423
aVStandard curves were constructed for each individual experiment, and results were expressed as PbTx-3 equivalents per microgram DNA in the original extract.
p9424
aVExtracts from controls did not have measurable matrix interference.
p9425
aVThe assay limit of detection for RIA of PbTx-3 was about 0.5 ng/mL.
p9426

p9427
aVThe mobile phase consisted of water (A) and methanol (B) in a binary system, with 0.18% formic acid as an additive.
p9428
aVThe elution gradient was 45\u201375% B for 30 min, and the flow rate was 0.l mL/min.
p9429
aVWe analyzed adduct formation using the Q-STAR quadropole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA).
p9430
aVThe mass spectrometer detected positive ions over the mass range m/z 300\u20131,400 or 100\u20131,400 atomic mass units (amu) at an orifice potential of 30 V. Selective molecular ions of nucleoside modified with brevetoxin, the molecular ions arising from the elimination of the ribose moiety from the parent compounds, and the loss of respective nucleobase were monitored.
p9431
aVUltraviolet chromatograms were also recorded at a wavelength of 260 nm.
p9432
aVRIA of PbTx-6 extracted from the incubation mixture with nucleosides identified a reduction in recovered brevetoxin immuno-reactivity, consistent with the formation of brevetoxin nucleoside adducts (Figure 2).
p9433
aVFigure 3A\u2013C shows the LC/MS peak of nucleoside adducts that were not observed in control mixtures.
p9434
aVOnly a single peak of brevetoxin adduct was identified with each of these nucleosides.
p9435
aVThe molecular ion of each adduct indicated that one molecule of PbTx-6 was adducted to each nucleoside.
p9436
aVPeaks had molecular ions corresponding to adduction products between PbTx-6 and nucleosides: retained at 11.8 min (m/z 1,154) for brevetoxin\u2013cytidine (Figure 3A) and at about 15 min (m/z 1,194) for brevetoxin\u2013guanosine adduct (Figure 3B).
p9437
aVUnbound PbTx-6 (m/z 911) was retained at about 18.5 min, identical for both control and treatments (Figure 3C).
p9438
aVFragmentation of nucleoside adducts resulted in initial elimination of the ribose moiety from the parent compounds: m/z 1,154 to m/z 1,022 for brevetoxin\u2013cytidine and m/z 1,194 to m/z 1,062 for brevetoxin\u2013guanosine.
p9439
aVThe loss of respective nucleobase was monitored in both adducts giving rise to ions m/z 112 or m/z 152 for cytosine or guanine, respectively.
p9440
aVFragments of nucleobase imine were seen as m/z 124 (C=N4\u2013) and m/z 164 (C=N2\u2013) for cytosine or guanine, respectively.
p9441
aVPbTx-6 was characterized by its daughter fragments m/z 857 and m/z 473 (Figure 3C).
p9442
aVLung cells exposed to PbTx-2 showed an approximate 4-fold increase in the amount of adduct compared to PbTx-6 treatment.
p9443
aVRIA showed 115.5 ± 31 pg PbTx-6 equivalents per microgram DNA for cells exposed to PbTx-2 and 34.1 ± 3 pg/\u03bcg DNA of cells exposed to PbTx-6.
p9444
aVLC/MS analysis of extracts of PbTx-2 exposure revealed molecular ions corresponding to products between brevetoxin and cytidine.
p9445
aVThese ions included m/z 1,022 (brevetoxin-nucleobase after losing the sugar moiety) and cytosine m/z 112 and cytosine N 4 imine m/z 124 (Figure 4).
p9446
aVNeither adduct parent molecule nor its legitimate sugar-free ion fragment was detected in PbTx-6 exposures.
p9447
aVA considerable amount of brevetoxin activity was retained in lung tissue 24 hr after exposure.
p9448
aVAn average of 136.3 ng PbTx-3 equivalents/g of lung tissue was measured for PbTx-2, while almost 2-fold more was measured in PbTx-6\u2013exposed rats.
p9449
aVRIA analyses of the nucleic acid hydrolysate showed about 4-fold greater adduct formation caused by PbTx-2 exposure (Figure 5).
p9450
aVFurther LC/MS analysis of the nucleic acid hydrosylate of PbTx-2\u2013exposed lung revealed three molecular ions corresponding to brevetoxin adducts with nucleosides.
p9451
aVThe brevetoxin\u2013guanosine adduct retained around 16 min (m/z 1,194) (Figure 6A), brevetoxin\u2013adenine (m/z 1,046) retained at about 14 min (Figure 6B), and the brevetoxin\u2013adenosine adduct retained at about 10.7 min (m/z 1,178; Figure 6C).
p9452
aVFragmentation spectra of nucleosidic adducts showed initial elimination of the sugar moiety to give daughter compounds: m/z 1,194 to m/z 1,062 for brevetoxin\u2013guanosine and m/z 1,178 to m/z 1,042 for brevetoxin\u2013guanosine.
p9453
aVThe loss of respective nucleobase was monitored in both adducts giving rise to ions m/z 152 or m/z 136 for guanine or adenine, respectively.
p9454
aVFragments of nucleobase imine were seen as m/z 164 (C=N2\u2013) and m/z 148 (C=N6\u2013).
p9455
aVWe could not detect adduct formation in hydrolysate extracts from PbTx-6 exposures using similar LC/MS conditions.
p9456
aVBrevetoxin, the red tide toxin, is well characterized for its neurotoxic toxic effects mediated by the voltage-gated sodium channel that are manifest in NSP (Ramsdell 2008).
p9457
aVRespiratory exposure to seawater aerosols containing brevetoxins leads to a different constellation of effects (Backer et al.
p9458
aV2005), some which are consistent with activation of voltage-gated sodium channels, whereas others may involve inflammatory reaction pathways (Bossart et al.
p9459
aV1998).
p9460
aVBrevetoxins can also lead to potential genotoxic effects.
p9461
aVIn vitro studies with human lymphocytes indicated that brevetoxins cause single-stranded and and double-stranded DNA breaks (Sayer et al.
p9462
aV2005), and a follow-up study in Chinese hamster ovary cells reported that brevetoxin causes chromosomal aberrations (Sayer et al.
p9463
aV2006).
p9464
aVSystemic absorption of brevetoxins by mammals leads to rapid metabolism to produce more readily excreted polar products (Radwan et al.
p9465
aV2005).
p9466
aVThe initial, or phase I reactions of brevetoxin include oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and epoxidation (Radwan and Ramsdell 2006).
p9467
aVEpoxidation of the H-ring of brevetoxin B leads to a series of reactive intermediates that are capable of covalently binding with DNA or causing oxidative DNA damage.
p9468
aVFormation of reactive intermediates is an initial step in the carcinogenic mechanisms of other well-known natural toxins such as aflatoxin (Groopman et al.
p9469
aV2005).
p9470
aVIn the present study we examined the subsequent step in this progression\u2014namely, the formation of brevetoxin\u2013nucleoside adducts in lung after intratracheal exposure to brevetoxins.
p9471
aVAdduct formation is a key step in inducing genotoxicity as a result of exposure to nucleic acid-damaging chemicals and metabolites.
p9472
aVWe focused on brevetoxin B analogs; however, similar processes can be expected for brevetoxin A analogs.
p9473
aVThe initial brevetoxin B produced by the algae has a reactive \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde extending from the terminal K-ring and has been designated as PbTx-2.
p9474
aVPbTx-2 is also subject to epoxidation, in the 27, 28 position of the H-ring designated PbTx-6, which as been found both in algal cells (Chou et al.
p9475
aV1985) and as a metabolic product of PbTx-2 in liver cells (Radwan and Ramsdell 2006).
p9476
aVIn this article, we first described the semisynthesis of brevetoxin\u2013nucleic acid adducts produced from reactions of PbTx-6 with cytosine and guanosine.
p9477
aVReaction of PbTx-6 with nucleosides was noted by a decrease in toxin activity in the assay mixture compared to the control, which suggests that nucleosidic adducts may have a lower affinity for brevetoxin antibody.
p9478
aVLC/MS data provided structural evidence for the formation of covalent brevetoxin\u2013cytidine and brevetoxin\u2013guanosine adducts.
p9479
aVThe MS/MS spectrum of each adduct was identified by a parent [M + PbTx-6+H]+ ion, and two major fragment ions: [M + PbTx-6 \u2013 132+H], probably formed by elimination of sugar moiety, and [M + PbTx-6 \u2013 132 \u2013 18+H], likely due to further loss of water.
p9480
aVElimination of respective nucleobase was observed as m/z 112 and m/z 152 for brevetoxin\u2013cytidine and brevetoxin\u2013guanosine, respectively.
p9481
aVRespective nucleobase imine fragments m/z 124 and m/z 164 were also observed, indicating that adduction sites of nucleobases toward brevetoxin occurs at least in part on the exocyclic NH2 groups of the base moieties.
p9482
aVLC/MS analysis did not yield sufficient structural information to confirm the site of nucleoside linkage to the H-ring epoxide.
p9483
aVBrevetoxin\u2013nucleoside adducts were examined after in vitro exposure of brevetoxins to lung fibroblasts and after in vivo exposure of rats to brevetoxins via intratracheal administration.
p9484
aVTwo brevetoxin congeners were chosen for exposure, PbTx-6, which has the H-ring epoxide, and PbTx-2, which has been found to be metabolized to form the H-ring epoxide in liver cells.
p9485
aVBoth brevetoxin congeners yielded brevetoxin immunoreactiv-ity to purified nucleoside fractions recovered from exposed lung cells and lung tissue; however, in each case PbTx-2 yielded four times the activity found with PbTx-6 treatment.
p9486
aVExtracted ion chromatograms identified brevetoxin adducts only with PbTx-2 treatment.
p9487
aVBrevetoxin\u2013cytidine adducts were detected in PbTx-2\u2013exposed lung cells, but no adducts were found in the nucleic acid extracts of lung cells exposed to PbTx-6 under the same LC/MS conditions.
p9488
aVAdducts of brevetoxin\u2013guanosine (m/z 1,194) and brevetoxin\u2013adenosine (m/z 1,178) were identified in the lung of rats exposed to PbTx-2 but not PbTx-6.
p9489
aVThese results are the first to establish the in vitro and in vivo formation of nucleic acid adducts after brevetoxin exposure.
p9490
aVAlthough the reactivity of PbTx-2, and not its epoxide PbTx-6, might be taken to mean that the epoxide is not the likely reactive group for conjugation with the nucleoside, further interpretation may indicate otherwise.
p9491
aVPbTx-6 also has the K-ring \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde, indicating that it should be as reactive for nucleoside conjugation by Michael addition as PbTx-2, which it is not.
p9492
aVThis suggests that epoxidation may be an intermediate step for PbTx-2 adduction.
p9493
aVEpoxides are very aggressive alkylating agents of nucleophilic sites of nucleosides, and epoxides formed metabolically may have a higher probability of binding to DNA.
p9494
aVHence, an epoxide formed intracellularly by metabolism of PbTx-2 would have greater access to DNA than the epoxide of PbTx-6 when administered into the animal.
p9495
aVDNA adduction to a metabolically formed epoxide of brevetoxin is also consistent with the report that both the single and double reduction of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde derivates of PbTx-2 caused DNA breaks in human lymphocytes as effectively as PbTx-2 (Sayer et al.
p9496
aV2005).
p9497
aVAdduction of guanosine or adenosine to the epoxide would lead to the brevetoxin\u2013guanosine and brevetoxin\u2013adenosine masses m/z 1,194 and 1,178, respectively, identified in lung nucleic acid hydrolytes.
p9498
aVHowever the K-ring R group \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde is also likely to react with the nucleoside.
p9499
aVFor example, Michael addition with the nucleoside and subsequent oxidation of the aldehyde to carboxylic acid would also lead to the same mass adduct products.
p9500
aVAdditional analysis will be necessary to provide full structural assignments of the brevetoxin\u2013nucleoside adducts in lung tissues.
p9501
aVThe structural assignment of the toxin nucleoside linkage, however, is less critical from a functional perspective, as multiple reaction products are bound to result from brevetoxin reactive intermediates.
p9502
aVIt is likely that more sensitive LC/MS techniques will identify additional brevetoxin\u2013nucleic acid and brevetoxin\u2013protein adducts in lung.
p9503
aVThis is important because, even though major toxin nucleic acid adducts product are necessary for the development of markers of exposure, less prominent adduct products are often responsible for genotoxic effects (Groopman et al.
p9504
aV2005).
p9505
aVThis study presents the first evidence that brevetoxins form nucleoside adducts in lung tissue.
p9506
aVWe identified brevetoxin\u2013guanosine (m/z 1,194) and brevetoxin\u2013adenosine (m/z 1,178) as major products of hydrolyzed lung DNA after intratracheal exposure of rats.
p9507
aVThe finding of brevetoxin conjugated to guanosine and adenosine after hydrolysis of lung DNA is consistent with brevetoxin metabolism resulting in a reactive intermediate capable of reaching the nucleus from its site of metabolism in the mitochondria to react with DNA purines.
p9508
aVDNA purine adducts are known to be unstable and to undergo depurination.
p9509
aVThe release of the nucleotide base adduct is an indication of a promutagenic lesion.
p9510
aVStructurally, the lesion in the DNA is the result of an apurinic site that remains in the DNA base sequence.
p9511
aVThe identification of brevetoxin\u2013nucleotide base (adenine) adduct (m/z 1,046) in addition to brevetoxin\u2013nucleoside (adenosine) adduct (m/z 1,178) in rat lung tissue is consistent with the formation of promutagenic lesions after brevetoxin exposure.
p9512
aVPromutagenic lesions resulting from depurination of aflatoxin\u2013nucleoside adducts are susceptible to faulty repair, causing G to T transversions, which have been shown to result in inactivation of the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene in aflatoxin-associated hepatocarcinoma (Kensler et al.
p9513
aV2003).
p9514
aVThe risk of brevetoxin adduct formation and resultant depurination is not known.
p9515
aVIndividuals are continually exposed to environmental agents capable of direct adduct formation as well as adduct formation through environmental agents that induce oxidative damage.
p9516
aVIt is possible that exposure to brevetoxins in aerosols, like other inhaled environmental genotoxic carcinogens, including polyacromatic hydrocarbons (Schoket 1999) and tobacco smoke (Wiencke 2002), add to the baseline levels of DNA adducts.
p9517
aVBaseline levels of adducts in humans are estimated to be in the range of 0.1\u20131.0 adduct per 108 unmodified DNA bases, and this burden can rise by four orders of magnitude in animals exposed to carcinogenic levels of genotoxic agents (Singh and Farmer 2006).
p9518
aVA question that remains is whether inhalation exposure to brevetoxin aerosols leads to significant lung DNA depurination.
p9519
aVKey to this question is the rate of brevetoxin adduction to DNA bases in lung and the extent of exposure.
p9520
aVThe identification of brevetoxin\u2013purine adducts now provides a foundation for biological monitoring of human exposure to such genotoxic environmental agents.
p9521
aVThe dose levels used in these in vitro and in vivo experiments were not meant to be reflective of human inhalation exposure to brevetoxins, which has been estimated at 3 and 20 ng/hr for red tide events in Florida (2003) and Texas (2000), respectively (Cheng et al.
p9522
aV2005; Pierce et al.

p9528
aVThe release of the nucleotide adduct from target tissue DNA as a result of depurination leads to the adduct elimination in urine.
p9529
aVIdentification of urinary nucleotide adducts using LC/MS has provided a foundation for large-scale monitoring studies of several genotoxic agents (Shuker and Farmer 1992; Singh and Farmer 2006) and could prove useful for brevetoxins as well.

aVRoxarsone (3-nitro-4-hydroxy benzene arsonic acid) is an arsenic compound widely used in the poultry industry as a feed additive to prevent coccidiosis, stimulate growth, and to improve tissue pigmentation.
p9531
aVLittle is known about the potential human health effects from roxarsone released into the environment from chicken waste or from residual compound in chicken products.
p9532
aVThe growth potentiation and enhanced tissue pigmentation suggest that low levels of roxarsone exposure may have an angiogenic potential similar to that of inorganic arsenite (AsIII).
p9533
aVThe goal of this investigation was to test the hypothesis described above using cultured human aortic and lung microvascular endothelial cells in high-content imaging tube-forming assays and begin developing a molecular level understanding of the process.
p9534
aVWe used a three-dimensional Matrigel assay for probing angiogenesis in cultured human endothelial cells, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array to probe the gene changes as a function of roxarsone or AsIII treatment.
p9535
aVIn addition, we used Western blot analysis for changes in protein concentration and activation.
p9536
aVRoxarsone was found to exhibit a higher angiogenic index than AsIII at lower concentrations.
p9537
aVIncreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was observed for roxarsone but not for AsIII-induced angiogenesis.
p9538
aVHowever, AsIII caused more rapid and pronounced phosphorylation of eNOS.
p9539
aVQuantitative PCR array on select genes revealed that the two compounds have different and often opposite effects on angiogenic gene expression.
p9540
aVThe results demonstrate that roxarsone and AsIII promote angiogenic phenotype in human endothelial cells through distinctly different signaling mechanisms.

aVArsenic contamination of drinking water is a worldwide public health concern.
p9542
aVThe extent of the concern in some countries has reached a point such that some are calling this humanity\u2019s largest mass poisoning (Bhattacharjee 2007).
p9543
aVEven low levels of exposure to arsenic have been linked to increased cardiovascular disease and hypertension (Chen et al.
p9544
aV2007; Navas Acien et al.
p9545
aV2005).
p9546
aVAlthough natural contamination of drinking water with inorganic arsenic represents the largest arsenical hazard to human health, environmental exposure to commercial organoarsenicals is a growing concern (Sapkota et al.
p9547
aV2007).
p9548
aVOrganoarsenicals such as roxarsone are widely used by the poultry industry (Arai et al.
p9549
aV2003; Brown et al.
p9550
aV2004; Chapman et al.
p9551
aV2002), with approximately 2.2 million pounds of roxarsone being fed to broiler chickens raised in the United States per year (Garbarino et al.
p9552
aV2003).
p9553
aVThe majority of roxarsone is excreted unchanged from chickens (Morrison 1969), while the remainder increases the total arsenic present in chicken tissue (Lasky et al.
p9554
aV2004).
p9555
aVThis residual roxarsone could amount to ingestion of 1.38\u20135.24 mg/day of arsenic at mean levels of chicken consumption (60 g/person/day) (Wallinga 2006).
p9556
aVThe excreted roxarsone may pose an environmental hazard, as microbes, including those residing in the gut microflora, can release inorganic arsenite (AsIII) from roxarsone (Stolz et al.
p9557
aV2007).
p9558
aVThe human health impacts of roxarsone have not been well studied, and the mechanisms for its biological effects in mammalian tissues are unknown.
p9559
aVIt has been suggested, however, that all of these biological effects require metabolism to inorganic AsIII (O\u2019Connor et al.
p9560
aV2005).
p9561
aVIn a variety of in vivo and in vitro models, nanomolar or low micromolar concentrations of arsenic (AsIII) stimulate angiogenesis and vascular remodeling that may promote vascular diseases and tumorigenesis (Kamat et al.
p9562
aV2005; Liu et al.
p9563
aV2006; Soucy et al.
p9564
aV2003, 2005).
p9565
aVIn addition to enhancing tumor growth, increased angiogenesis would contribute to overall growth potential and increased tissue pigmentation.
p9566
aVThese are the attributes of roxarsone that contribute to its widespread use; however, the cellular effects of roxarsone to mammalian cells are not known.
p9567
aVFurther, it is unclear whether the vascular effects of roxarsone are dependent on its metabolism to inorganic arsenic.
p9568
aVHerein we report the angiogenic potential of roxarsone and compare it with that of inorganic arsenite (AsIII).
p9569
aVIn addition, we report different modes of action of these two compounds in promoting angiogenesis.

aVHuman aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) (Clonetics; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) were cultured at 5% CO2 in complete MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), 1% pen/strep, 1% hydrocortisone, 2 mM l-glu-tamine, and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).

aVConcentration-responsive effects of roxarsone and AsIII on the angiogenic potential of HAEC and HMVEC were compared in quantitative high-content cellular imaging tube-formation assays in Matrigel (Figure 1).
p9597
aVImages of fluorescently labeled cells were analyzed by an algorithm that identified the angiogenic tubes formed by the association and clustering of the endothelial cells and quantitatively measured the properties of the identified tubes such as the number of tubes, tube lengths, tube areas, number of nodal branch points, and the angiogenic index.
p9598
aVThe angiogenic index is defined as the percentage of image area covered by tubes multiplied by 10 (Ghosh et al.
p9599
aV2007; Grove and Ghosh 2006).
p9600
aVBoth compounds were as effective as vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) in increasing the angiogenic index above the value for untreated control cells in both cell types (Figures 1 and 2).
p9601
aVBoth cell types exhibited strong angiogenic responses with the arsenical treatments; however, the HMVEC showed a higher basal level of angiogenesis (Table 1).
p9602
aVBecause of their lower basal angiogenic activity, HAEC were used for additional mechanistic studies.
p9603
aVThe angiogenic threshold for roxarsone was between 0.001 and 0.01 \u03bcM, an order of magnitude lower than the threshold for AsIII (Figures 1 and 2).
p9604
aVAs we have previously shown in in vivo chicken allantoic membrane angiogenesis assays (Soucy et al.
p9605
aV2003),
p9606
aVabove 1 \u03bcM AsIII becomes toxic to tube formation and inhibits angiogenesis (Figure 2).
p9607
aVIn contrast, even 10 \u03bcM roxarsone showed no decrease in the angiogenic index (Figures 1 and 2) or signs of toxicity in the endothelial cells (data not shown).
p9608
aVThe fact that the efficacy for tube formation was similar, but the toxic potential differs, suggested that the two arsenicals differ in their mechanisms of action.
p9609
aVNitric oxide (NO) production is required for certain stimuli to promote angiogenesis (Yu et al.
p9610
aV2005), but AsIII is known to promote reactive oxygen that limits available NO release in endothelial cells (Barchowsky et al.
p9611
aV1999a, Bunderson et al.
p9612
aV2006).
p9613
aVThe data in Figure 3 demonstrate that roxarsone requires NO generation to increase angiogenesis.
p9614
aVIts effects were blocked by the eNOS inhibitor l-NG-nitroarginine methylester (L-NAME), but not its inactive enantiomer d -NG-nitroarginine methylester (D-NAME).
p9615
aVIn contrast, both NAME enantiomers prevented AsIII from increasing the angiogenic index.
p9616
aVThis would suggest either that AsIII inhibition by NAME was a nonstereospecific chemical effect or that D-NAME interacted with AsIII in a unique manner relative to roxarsone.
p9617
aVThus, roxarsone and inorganic AsIII appeared to have differential effects on signaling for NO-mediated angiogenesis.
p9618
aVTo investigate a possible mechanism for increased eNOS activity after exposure to arsenicals, we exposed HAEC to either roxarsone or AsIII for 0.5\u20134 hr, then probed for levels of serine phosphorylated eNOS relative to total eNOS.
p9619
aVAs shown in Figure 4, both arsenicals caused time-dependent increases in Ser1177 phosphorylation of eNOS.
p9620
aVHowever, roxarsone caused a progressive increase over 4 hr, whereas AsIII caused a rapid stimulation of phosphorylation that was declining by 4 hr.
p9621
aVThese data indicate that the arsenicals do not share similar common upstream signaling actions that enhance the activity of AKT, a serine/threonine protein kinase, which commonly accounts for serine phosphorylation (Dimmeler et al.
p9622
aV1999; Fulton et al.
p9623
aV1999).
p9624
aVIn addition, the time course for the effects of AsIII is consistent with its known ability to stimulate vascular NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide that quenches NO to form peroxynitrite (Bunderson et al.
p9625
aV2002; Lynn et al.
p9626
aV2000; Smith et al.
p9627
aV2001).
p9628
aVThese oxidants often mediate inflammatory angiogenesis (Ushio-Fukai and Alexander 2004) and thus may account for the mechanism of action for AsIII.
p9629
aVAnalysis of the effects of the two arsenicals on angiogenic gene activity further indicated that roxarsone and AsIII signal through distinct but overlapping mechanisms.
p9630
aVSuperarray quantitative PCR arrays of total RNA extracts from HMVEC treated with either arsenical for 24 hr demonstrated that the arsenicals differentially affect expression of a limited set of 9 of 84 inducible genes measured.
p9631
aVAsIII induced more genes than it inhibited (Table 2).
p9632
aVAt 0.1 \u03bcM, roxarsone inhibited more genes than it induced (Table 2).
p9633
aVSeveral genes were affected in the same direction, but not to the same degree by the two agents.
p9634
aVBoth arsenicals decreased angiogenic repressive interferon 1\u03b1 (Strieter et al.
p9635
aV2005) and interferon-inducible CXCL9 transcripts.
p9636
aVIt was interesting that generally the higher roxarsone concentration (1.0 \u03bcM) had either no effect on gene expression or the opposite effect of the low concentration.
p9637
aVThe exception was the concentration-dependent induction of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA levels by both roxarsone concentrations.
p9638
aVAsIII also strongly induced HGF transcripts.
p9639
aVIt is difficult to reconcile the differential effects of AsIII and the two concentrations of roxarsone on gene expression with their concentration-dependent effects on angiogenic potential.
p9640
aVIt is possible that induction of a dominant factor, such as HGF, accounted for the observed increases in tube formation.
p9641
aVHowever, the analysis was limited by the small number of gene changes measured and a lack of information regarding protein changes that may account for increased angiogenic index.
p9642
aVAlthough beyond the scope of the current studies, additional mechanistic experiments would delineate the linkage between any gene or protein change and increased angiogenic index after arsenical exposure.
p9643
aVNonetheless, these data demonstrate that roxarsone and inorganic AsIII signal through different mechanisms to affect induction of genes that regulate angiogenesis.
p9644
aVOur results in human endothelial cell cultures demonstrate that roxarsone was a more potent inducer of angiogenesis than inorganic AsIII, and that roxarsone and AsIII signal through separate pathways to promote angiogenesis.
p9645
aVThe arsenicals had different time courses for phosphorylating eNOS; only the effects of roxarsone were blocked specifically by eNOS inhibition, and the two arsenicals differentially affected angiogenic gene induction.
p9646
aVIn addition to these differential effects, the fact that roxarsone is more potent for tube formation and less cytotoxic supports the conclusion that metabolism to inorganic AsIII cannot account for its vascular effects.
p9647
aVMore importantly, this was the first demonstration of functional vascular effects of roxarsone that may implicate a disease risk.
p9648
aV0
aV0 studies are needed to demonstrate the mechanisms that enable differential signaling by the two arsenicals and the impact of this signaling in human endothelial cells on vascular disease promoted by their environmental exposures.

aVSulindac is an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that affects prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COX) 1 and 2.
p9650
aVSulindac has also been of interest for more than decade as a chemopreventive for adenomatous colorectal polyps and colon cancer.
p9651
aVPretreatment of human colon and lung cancer cells with sulindac enhances killing by an oxidizing agent such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or hydrogen peroxide.
p9652
aVThis effect does not involve cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition.
p9653
aVHowever, under the conditions used, there is a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the cancer cells and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential,
p9654
aVsuggesting that cell death is due to apoptosis, which was confirmed by Tunel assay.
p9655
aVIn contrast, this enhanced killing was not observed with normal lung or colon cells.
p9656
aVThese results indicate that normal and cancer cells handle oxidative stress in different ways and sulindac can enhance this difference.
p9657
aVThe combination of sulindac and an oxidizing agent could have therapeutic value.
p9658
aVSulindac was one of the early non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which affect prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COX) 1 and 2 [1].
p9659
aVFor more than a decade, sulindac has also been of interest as a chemopreventive treatment for adenomatous colorectal polyps and colon cancer [2]\u2013[5], especially in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis [6].
p9660
aVSulindac has also been reported as a chemopreventive agent for mouse urinary bladder cancer [7].
p9661
aVThe anti-tumorigenic activity of sulindac against colon cancer may involve both COX inhibition [2] and activities that are independent of COX inhibition [8]\u2013[11].
p9662
aVIt has been reported that sulindac induces apoptosis of colon cancer cells, [11], [12], which appears to involve changes in gene expression [12]\u2013[18].
p9663
aVSulindac is a pro-drug that must be converted to the active COX-inhibitor, sulindac sulfide [19].
p9664
aVWe have previously shown that conversion of sulindac to sulindac sulfide can be catalyzed by MsrA, a member of the methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) family of enzymes [20].
p9665
aVThe Msr system has been studied in detail in recent years, after it was shown that MsrA may play a role in aging and age related diseases [21]\u2013[23].
p9666
aVThe obvious function of the Msr system is to reduce methionine sulfoxide (Met(o)) in proteins back to methionine (Met) (reviewed in [23]), although it also functions as part of a ROS scavenger system, in which the Msr system permits Met residues in protein to function as catalytic antioxidants [24].
p9667
aVSupport for the scavenger role of MsrA has come from recent studies with both PC-12 neuronal cells, in which MsrA was overexpressed [25], and human lens cells, in which MsrA expression was down regulated [26].
p9668
aVThus, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the Msr system plays an important role in protecting cells against oxidative damage.
p9669
aVSince sulindac is a substrate for MsrA [20], it seemed reasonable that the killing of cancer cells by sulindac might involve oxidative stress.
p9670
aVAdditionally, we wanted to determine whether normal cells and cancer cells responded in a similar way(s) after sulindac treatment and oxidative stress.
p9671
aVIn a preliminary study, we showed that treatment of a squamous cell cancer cell line with sulindac and an oxidizing agent led to nearly a 500% increase in intracellular ROS levels and significant cell death.
p9672
aVIn contrast, normal human epidermal keratinocytes did not show an increase in ROS levels or cell death.
p9673
aVThese results led to a limited clinical trial that showed promising potential of using topical application of sulindac and hydrogen peroxide for treatment of actinic keratoses [27].
p9674
aVIn the present studies we extended these earlier results using cancer cell lines derived from lung and colon tissue.
p9675
aVWe provide further evidence that the enhanced killing observed with sulindac and oxidative stress involves mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell death via apoptosis.
p9676
aVThese new data strengthen the potential for specifically enhancing the therapeutic application of sulindac and its derivatives for cancer treatment by using them in conjunction with a compound that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS).
p9677
aVHuman lung and colon cancer cell lines were preincubated in the presence or absence of sulindac for 48 hours.
p9678
aVExcess sulindac was removed by washing prior to the 2 hr incubation with TBHP as described in the Materials and Methods.
p9679
aVSulindac was used at 500 µM final concentration since preliminary experiments using sulindac at this concentration showed no significant effect on cell viability for either of the cancer cell lines.
p9680
aVEach cancer cell line had a marked decrease in cell viability in the presence of TBHP following pretreatment with 500 µM sulindac (Figure 1A and 1B).
p9681
aVViability of lung cancer cells pretreated with sulindac was reduced by greater than 80% following incubation for 2 hr with 240 µM TBHP when compared to control cells that were not pretreated with sulindac (Figure 1A).
p9682
aVSimilar responses to TBHP were observed with sulindac treated colon cancer cells (Figure 1B), although a higher concentration of TBHP was required for significant killing of the colon cancer cells.
p9683
aVSulindac also enhanced the killing of both cancer cell lines when TBHP was replaced with hydrogen peroxide, at concentrations between 1.0 mM and 6.0 mM (Figure 2).
p9684
aVSeveral lines of evidence indicate that the enhanced killing of cancer cells by sulindac and oxidative stress does not involve COX inhibition.
p9685
aVTwo other NSAIDs, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and ibuprofen, at 500 µM, failed to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to oxidative stress (Figure 3A and 3B, respectively).
p9686
aVAs noted above, sulindac is a pro-drug that must be converted to the active COX-inhibitor, sulindac sulfide [19], primarily through the activity of MsrA [20].
p9687
aVTo determine whether the enhanced killing of sulindac-treated cancer cells by TBHP involved reduction of sulindac to sulindac sulfide,
p9688
aVthe active inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, the experiments described above were repeated using sulindac sulfone, which is not a substrate for MsrA (unpublished data) or a COX inhibitor [28].
p9689
aVBecause of increased toxicity of sulindac sulfone a lower concentration (250 µM) was used for these experiments.
p9690
aVPretreatment of lung cancer cells with 250 µM sulindac sulfone (Figure 3C), followed by exposure to TBHP gave comparable results to those seen using 500 µM sulindac (compare Figures 1A and 3C).
p9691
aVSimilar results using sulindac sulfone were also obtained with the colon cancer cells lines (data not shown).
p9692
aVThus, the collective data indicate that the increased sensitivity of sulindac treated cancer cells to oxidative stress, under the conditions used, does not involve either the Msr system or COX inhibition.
p9693
aVIt was important to determine whether the enhanced killing effect of sulindac and sulindac sulfone on cancer cells in the presence of TBHP (Figure 1) also occurred with normal, non-immortalized cells.
p9694
aVFigure 4 shows the effect of pretreating normal lung cells with sulindac or sulindac sulfone on cell viability after oxidative stress using TBHP.
p9695
aVIncubation of normal lung cells with 500 µM sulindac for 48 hr prior to exposure to TBHP not only did not enhance killing, but sulindac provided protection from oxidative stress caused by TBHP (Figure 4A).
p9696
aVThe protective effect from oxidative stress on normal lung cells was also observed when cells were pretreated with sulindac sulfone (Figure 4B).
p9697
aVSimilar experiments were performed using the normal colon cells.
p9698
aVThere was no effect on cell viability in the presence of TBHP when the normal colon cells were pretreated with either 500 µM sulindac or 250 µM sulindac sulfone (data not shown).
p9699
aVThus, neither normal lung nor normal colon cells showed enhanced killing by TBHP following treatment with sulindac or sulindac sulfone, as was observed with the two cancer cell lines.
p9700
aVLung cancer cells were used to gain more information on the mechanism of the enhanced killing effect of sulindac in the presence of TBHP.
p9701
aVTo investigate whether the enhanced killing of the cancer cells observed with sulindac and oxidative stress might involve mitochondrial dysfunction, changes in the level of intracellular ROS were determined.
p9702
aVFor these experiments lung cancer cells were treated with sulindac for 48 hours, exposed to TBHP and then the intracellular ROS level was visualized using a fluorescent dye as described in the Materials and Methods.
p9703
aVThe results are shown in Figure 5.
p9704
aVCompared to untreated lung cancer cells (Figure 5A), cells treated with sulindac alone (Figure 5B) or TBHP alone (Figure 5C) showed a modest increase (53\u201358%) in ROS levels based on appearance of green fluorescence.
p9705
aVHowever, lung cancer cells that were pretreated with 500 µM sulindac followed by a 2 hr incubation with 80 µM TBHP (Figure 5D) had a 400% increase in intracellular green fluorescence compared to untreated cells (compare Figure 5A and 5D).
p9706
aVThese data clearly show that pretreatment of the lung cancer cells with sulindac leads to a large increase in intracellular ROS following exposure to oxidative stress,
p9707
aVsupporting the results on skin cancer cells reported recently [27].
p9708
aVTo further explore the mechanism of killing cancer cells exposed to oxidative stress after pretreatment with sulindac, we investigated whether there is a concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which is known to initiate apoptotic cell death.
p9709
aVEffects on mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated using changes in the fluorescence of the JC-1 dye as described in Materials and Methods.
p9710
aVThe results are shown in Figure 6.
p9711
aVThe top panels show red fluorescent images and the lower panels green fluorescent images.
p9712
aVLoss of mitochondrial membrane potential would result in decreased red fluorescence and a corresponding increase in green fluorescence.
p9713
aVRelative to untreated cells (Figure 6A) or cells treated with only sulindac (Figure 6B) or TBHP alone (Figure 6C), sulindac pretreatment of lung cancer cells followed by oxidative stress (Figure 6D) resulted in disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential as evidenced by nearly a 20-fold increase in green fluorescence (see legend of Figure 6 for additional details).
p9714
aVIn summary, pretreatment of the lung cancer cells with sulindac followed by treatment with TBHP leads to a marked increase in intracellular ROS and a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
p9715
aVThese results indicated that cell death was occurring via apoptosis, which was confirmed by Tunel analysis (Supplementary Figure S1)
p9716
aVSulindac and its metabolites, such as sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone, have been shown to have anti-cancer activity [29].
p9717
aVConsistent with our previous study of skin cancer cells [27], we have shown that the killing of lung and colon tumor cell lines can be enhanced significantly if sulindac is combined with an oxidant, such as TBHP or hydrogen peroxide.
p9718
aVWe also have shown that sulindac pretreatment can enhance the killing of skin cancer cells caused by arsenic trioxide (data not shown), which kills cancer cells by generating intracellular ROS,
p9719
aVas reported elsewhere for lung cancer cells [30].
p9720
aVIt seems reasonable that sulindac may enhance the efficacy of any anticancer drug where the mechanism of action involves oxidative damage.
p9721
aVThe successful application of a multiple drug therapy has been recently reported for a clinical trial involving almost 300 patients at risk for recurrence of colorectal adenomas who were treated with a combination of sulindac and difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis [31].
p9722
aVIt appears likely that the mechanism of the selective killing of cancer cells seen in these studies involves mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly as a result of increased ROS production.
p9723
aVWhile treatment of cancer cells with sulindac or TBHP individually leads to a modest increase in the level of ROS (Figure 5B and [27], [32]), there is a dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of ROS in cells pretreated with sulindac and then exposed to TBHP (Figure 5D).
p9724
aVIn addition, there is a significant disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential under the same experimental conditions (Figure 6), suggesting that sulindac causes apoptosis in cancer cells exposed to oxidative stress.
p9725
aVThe anticancer effect of sulindac alone has been reported to involve apoptotic death [33].
p9726
aVThe results with sulindac sulfone and other NSAIDs indicate that the effect of sulindac in our system does not involve COX inhibition or the Msr system.
p9727
aVThe present results indicate a fundamental difference in the way normal and cancer cells respond to oxidative stress.
p9728
aVSulindac and its metabolites can accentuate this difference, which leads to enhanced killing of cancer cells, but not normal cells, by oxidative stress.
p9729
aVIt is well established that cancer and normal cells differ in their oxidative metabolism and that cancer cells have a higher rate of glycolysis than normal cells, a phenomenon first described by Warburg [34].
p9730
aVThere also is compelling evidence that cancer cells are typically under greater oxidative stress compared to normal cells [35].
p9731
aVA difference between normal and cancer cells to oxidative stress that has been reported is the cytotoxicity caused by glucose deprivation.
p9732
aVStudies by Spitz and coworkers [36] have clearly shown that this effect is mediated by mitochondrial ROS production.
p9733
aVThe results described provide further evidence that a combination of sulindac and an oxidizing agent might have clinical therapeutic value in treating a variety of cancers.
p9734
aVIn a previous preliminary study we reported that the results of a limited proof of concept human clinical trial using sulindac (1\u20135%) and hydrogen peroxide (25%) gels applied daily for three weeks on actinic keratoses (AK) involving the upper extremities [27].
p9735
aVUpon completion, all ten treated AKs showed a reduction in size as shown by clinical photography with five exhibiting complete disappearance of the precancerous cells after skin biopsy.
p9736
aVThese preliminary results warrant more extensive clinical trials.
p9737
aVSulindac, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), (S)-(+)-ibuprofen, and tert butyl-hydroperoxide (TBHP) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

p9747
aVThe culture medium was then removed and the cells washed once with fresh culture medium with serum.
p9748
aVAfter removal of the wash solution, fresh culture medium with serum that contained the indicated final concentration of TBHP or hydrogen peroxide was added to the cells, and the cells were incubated an additional 2 hours.
p9749

p9750
aVCell viability was determined by the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega; Madison, WI) according to the manufacture's instructions.
p9751
aVThe assay utilizes a novel tetrazolium compound that metabolically active cells convert to a water-soluble formazan by the action of cellular dehydrogenases, which is measured by absorbance at 490 nm using a colorimetric microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax Plus384; Molecular Devices).
